                <description><![CDATA[In this enlightening episode of Everyday's a Something, we delve into the fascinating origins of National Eat Your Vegetables Day and its revolutionary founder, Dr. Sarah Henderson. Set against the backdrop of a 1974 farmers market, the episode chronicles how one nutritionist's creative vision transformed America's relationship with vegetables from obligation to celebration. Through engaging storytelling, we explore Dr. Henderson's groundbreaking approach of making vegetables fun rather than focusing solely on their health benefits. The narrative weaves through historical milestones, including Rosalynn Carter's influential White House garden, to modern innovations like the "Vibrant Aging Initiative" by the Council for Retirement Security. Listeners will discover how this grassroots movement evolved into a nationwide celebration, featuring everything from vegetable costume contests to "Veggie Speed Dating" events. The episode culminates with practical suggestions for celebrating, encouraging listeners to embrace unfamiliar vegetables and explore new culinary horizons, embodying Dr. Henderson's philosophy that "Every vegetable is just a friend you haven't met yet."
