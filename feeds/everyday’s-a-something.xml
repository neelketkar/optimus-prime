                <description><![CDATA[Dive into the fascinating origin of National Splurge Day in this illuminating episode of Everyday's a Something. From its unexpected birth in 1994 by Chicago's "eventologist" Adrienne Sioux Koopersmith to its modern-day significance, discover how this unique holiday transformed America's relationship with guilt-free spending. The episode explores Koopersmith's revolutionary vision, emerging from her observation of Americans' puritanical approach to money during the post-recession era. Learn how the concept of a "splurge" has evolved from a modest $50 in 1994 to over $200 today, reflecting significant shifts in consumer behavior and economic perspectives. The narrative delves into how major retailers have embraced this celebration with "guilt-free" discounts, while financial advisors promote "strategic splurging" as a balanced approach to personal indulgence. This compelling exploration of consumer psychology, economic trends, and cultural evolution reveals how one woman's mission to normalize occasional treating has become a nationally recognized celebration of mindful indulgence.
