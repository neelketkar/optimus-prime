                <description><![CDATA[In this enlightening episode of Everyday's a Something, we delve into the fascinating origins and evolution of National Eat Your Vegetables Day, a celebration that transformed from a grassroots cafeteria initiative to a nationwide movement. Journey back to 1996 Des Moines, where determined lunch lady Martha Burkhardt and her team launched "Operation Green Light," a creative response to vegetable waste in school cafeterias. The episode explores how this local program blossomed into a national observance by 2001, catalyzing a remarkable shift in American eating habits. Listeners will discover surprising statistics, including how Americans now consume 47% more vegetable varieties than in the mid-1990s, and learn about the explosive growth of vegetable-based alternatives in modern cuisine. From cauliflower pizza crusts to zucchini noodles, the episode showcases how innovation has turned formerly overlooked vegetables into the stars of billion-dollar industries. The narrative weaves together personal stories, practical advice, and cultural insights, culminating in an inspiring call to culinary adventure that encourages listeners to step out of their comfort zones and embrace unfamiliar vegetables.
