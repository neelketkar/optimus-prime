                <description><![CDATA[Dive into the fascinating origins of National Splurge Day in this captivating episode of Everyday's a Something, where we uncover the story behind America's official day of guilt-free indulgence. Created by Chicago's eccentric lifestyle guru Adrienne Sioux Koopersmith in 1994, this unique holiday challenges our perceptions of self-care and personal spending. From the historic lines outside Bergdorf's to modern-day celebrations, we explore how this holiday has evolved from a simple permission slip for luxury purchases into a broader conversation about meaningful indulgence. Learn why 78% of Americans now prefer experiential splurges over material goods, and how major retailers like Nordstrom and Saks have embraced the holiday with luxury discounts. The episode delves into the concept of "mindful splurging" and examines how different people interpret the art of treating themselves - whether it's an expensive handbag, a premium coffee, or a memorable weekend getaway. Through expert insights and cultural analysis, we reveal how this quirky holiday has become a powerful reminder that sometimes the best investment is in our own happiness, proving that Koopersmith's mission to normalize guilt-free pleasure continues to resonate in today's world.
