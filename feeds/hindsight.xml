                    <description><![CDATA[In this powerful episode of Hindsight, host Sarah Chen uncovers the haunting parallel between recent explosions in Tehran and a tragic event from Iran's past. The episode masterfully weaves together two moments in Iranian history: the devastating attacks of June 2025 and the execution of seventeen Bahá'í women educators in 1983. Known as "Black Friday," this historical atrocity occurred when young women, the youngest just seventeen, were executed for operating an underground education network in defiance of post-revolution restrictions. Their crime was simply teaching children to read, serving not only their Bahá'í community but any child in need. The narrative draws compelling connections between past and present, examining how the persecution of religious minorities and the struggle for educational rights in Iran continues to resonate four decades later. Through careful analysis of current satellite imagery and US State Department briefings, the episode illuminates how modern-day conflicts echo historical patterns of oppression, while highlighting the enduring impact of these seventeen brave educators whose sacrifice inspired generations of activists fighting for educational freedom and human rights.

                    <description><![CDATA[In this illuminating episode of Hindsight, we delve into the monumental Battle of Waterloo on its 210th anniversary, exploring how this pivotal moment in European history continues to shape our world today. From the rain-soaked fields of Belgium to modern military strategy, the episode masterfully draws parallels between Napoleon's final stand and contemporary global conflicts. Host expertly unpacks the battle's lasting impact, from its contribution to everyday language with phrases like "meeting your Waterloo" to its cultural influence on everything from London's infrastructure to pop culture through ABBA's Eurovision victory. The narrative skillfully weaves together the tactical significance of Napoleon's fateful delay, Wellington's strategic brilliance, and the devastating human cost of 45,000 lives lost. Beyond the historical account, this episode of Hindsight reveals how Waterloo's lessons about timing, technology, and tactical advantage remain remarkably relevant in an era of satellite warfare and cyber capabilities, demonstrating how yesterday's battlefield decisions continue to inform modern military doctrine.
