                    <description><![CDATA[In this riveting episode of The Daily Scandal, we delve into the controversial history of Olestra, Procter & Gamble's ambitious attempt to revolutionize the American diet with a zero-calorie synthetic fat substitute. From its accidental discovery in a Cincinnati laboratory in 1968 to its spectacular market failure, this episode unravels the fascinating story of how a "miracle ingredient" became one of the food industry's most notorious cautionary tales. Host Sarah Chen guides listeners through P&G's unprecedented 24-year FDA approval process, the initial success of WOW chips that generated $400 million in first-year sales, and the subsequent avalanche of consumer complaints that led to its downfall. The episode explores how Olestra's infamous side effects, including the dreaded "anal leakage," became fodder for late-night comedy and early internet forums, ultimately leading to its commercial demise. Beyond the corporate drama, this story examines deeper questions about our relationship with food technology, the true cost of seeking dietary shortcuts, and the complex interplay between scientific innovation and public trust. The episode serves as a compelling reminder that sometimes the most valuable lessons come from our biggest failures.
