The journey reveals family-friendly destinations starting at the Santa Monica Public Library, where a state-of-the-art teen tech lab offers 3D printing and robotics experiences with complimentary two-hour parking. In the Pico neighborhood, Games and Stuff café houses over 500 board games with expert staff guidance. The fascinating Museum of Jurassic Technology showcases peculiar exhibits including microscopic sculptures and curious artifacts, open Thursday through Sunday with special evening hours on weekdays. The Arts District, accessible via the Alameda exit, features various creative spaces including Inner-City Arts, offering a safe creative environment for young artists.
