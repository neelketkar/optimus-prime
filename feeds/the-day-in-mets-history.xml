                    <description><![CDATA[In this poignant episode of The Day in Mets History, we explore the profound significance of June 22nd in New York Mets lore, weaving together three pivotal moments that shaped the franchise's narrative. From the sun-drenched afternoon at Shea Stadium in 1969, where Jerry Koosman and the emerging "Miracle Mets" demonstrated their legitimacy against the defending NL champion Cardinals, to the emotional farewell of Tom "The Franchise" Seaver in 1987, the episode captures the essence of Mets baseball. Seaver's retirement announcement, marking the end of a stellar 20-year career that included 311 wins and three Cy Young awards, represents a pivotal moment in baseball history. The episode also highlights Claudell Washington's remarkable three-homer performance at Dodger Stadium in 1977, illustrating baseball's capacity for unexpected brilliance. Through masterful storytelling, this episode connects these seemingly disparate events into a compelling narrative about perseverance, legacy, and the enduring spirit of New York Mets baseball, reminding listeners why certain dates become eternally etched in a franchise's history.

                    <description><![CDATA[In a historic display of power hitting, the New York Mets shattered their seven-game losing streak with an extraordinary seven solo home run performance at Citizens Bank Park. This episode of The Day in Mets History captures the electric atmosphere of June 22, 2025, when the Mets unleashed an offensive barrage not seen in Major League Baseball since 2016. The game's defining moment came in the third inning, as Francisco Lindor, Brandon Nimmo, and Juan Soto delivered consecutive home runs, electrifying the baseball world. Soto's remarkable performance, including two home runs, placed him in elite company as he recorded his 27th multi-homer game before age 27. Beyond the final score of 11-4, this game represented a potential turning point in the Mets' 2025 season. The victory, celebrated to the sounds of "New York Groove" in the visitors' clubhouse, showcased not just offensive prowess but the resilient spirit of a team finding its rhythm. This episode delves into the significance of this memorable night, exploring how seven solo shots transformed from mere statistics into symbols of revival, weaving another remarkable chapter into the rich tapestry of Mets baseball history.

                    <description><![CDATA[Tom Seaver's masterful pitching performance on a sweltering 90-degree afternoon at Shea Stadium in 1969 stands as one of baseball's most memorable near-perfect games. For eight and one-third innings, Seaver dominated the Philadelphia Phillies, retiring the first 25 batters in order as the tension mounted with each passing frame. The Mets' ace, supported by Tommie Agee's solo home run, carried a perfect game into the ninth inning before Jimmy Qualls delivered a clean single to left-center field with one out. Despite losing the perfect game, Seaver completed a brilliant shutout with 10 strikeouts in the Mets' 4-0 victory. The same date in 1964 witnessed another historic moment at Shea Stadium when the Mets and Phillies engaged in an epic 23-inning marathon that remains the longest complete game in Mets history. The seven-hour, twenty-three-minute contest featured 17 pitchers throwing a staggering 658 pitches, with the Phillies finally prevailing in the 23rd inning.
