                    <description><![CDATA[In this poignant episode of The Day in Mets History, we explore the profound significance of June 22nd in New York Mets lore, weaving together three pivotal moments that shaped the franchise's narrative. From the sun-drenched afternoon at Shea Stadium in 1969, where Jerry Koosman and the emerging "Miracle Mets" demonstrated their legitimacy against the defending NL champion Cardinals, to the emotional farewell of Tom "The Franchise" Seaver in 1987, the episode captures the essence of Mets baseball. Seaver's retirement announcement, marking the end of a stellar 20-year career that included 311 wins and three Cy Young awards, represents a pivotal moment in baseball history. The episode also highlights Claudell Washington's remarkable three-homer performance at Dodger Stadium in 1977, illustrating baseball's capacity for unexpected brilliance. Through masterful storytelling, this episode connects these seemingly disparate events into a compelling narrative about perseverance, legacy, and the enduring spirit of New York Mets baseball, reminding listeners why certain dates become eternally etched in a franchise's history.

                    <description><![CDATA[In a historic display of power hitting, the New York Mets shattered their seven-game losing streak with an extraordinary seven solo home run performance at Citizens Bank Park. This episode of The Day in Mets History captures the electric atmosphere of June 22, 2025, when the Mets unleashed an offensive barrage not seen in Major League Baseball since 2016.

Beyond the final score of 11-4, this game represented a potential turning point in the Mets' 2025 season. The victory, celebrated to the sounds of "New York Groove" in the visitors' clubhouse, showcased not just offensive prowess but the resilient spirit of a team finding its rhythm. This episode delves into the significance of this memorable night, exploring how seven solo shots transformed from mere statistics into symbols of revival, weaving another remarkable chapter into the rich tapestry of Mets baseball history.

                    <description><![CDATA[Journey back to a sweltering June afternoon at Shea Stadium in 1969 as "The Day in Mets History" podcast recounts Tom Seaver's near-perfect masterpiece against the Philadelphia Phillies. This gripping episode weaves together two remarkable tales from Mets history, both occurring on June 21st. First, experience the electric atmosphere as Tom "Terrific" Seaver carries a perfect game into the ninth inning, only to have it broken up by Jimmy Qualls' single with one out. Seaver's dominant performance, featuring 10 strikeouts in a 4-0 victory, stands as one of the greatest pitching displays in Shea Stadium history. The episode then transitions to an equally extraordinary game from 1964, when the Mets and Phillies engaged in an epic 23-inning marathon that lasted over seven hours. This contest, still the longest complete game in Mets history, saw 17 pitchers combine for 658 pitches while surrendering just seven runs total. Through vivid storytelling and historical context, this episode captures the essence of Mets baseball, celebrating the perseverance and drama that have defined the franchise since its earliest days.
