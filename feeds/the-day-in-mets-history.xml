The struggling Mets, in just their second season, create an unforgettable moment when Harkness steps to the plate against Jim Brewer with the bases loaded and two outs, delivering the franchise's first walk-off grand slam. Twenty years later to the day, Rusty Staub etches his own name in baseball history by recording his eighth consecutive pinch hit, tying a major league record. The veteran's remarkable achievement showcases his mastery of one of baseball's most challenging roles, as he would go on to set a record with eleven pinch-hit walks and 81 pinch-hit at-bats that season.

                    <description><![CDATA[Baseball's poetic symmetry takes center stage as Juan Soto's spectacular two-homer performance at Citi Field mirrors a historic June 25th from Mets lore. In 1976, Mike Phillips transformed an 0-for-21 slump into an unforgettable achievement, hitting for the cycle at Wrigley Field with methodical precision: a single, double, triple, and the crowning home run in the ninth. Fast forward to 2025, and Soto's 27th career multi-homer game writes a new chapter in the ongoing narrative of June 25th magic. The date holds another remarkable footnote from 1989, when the Mets accomplished a defensive rarity in their 5-1 victory over Philadelphia – completing nine innings without a single fielding assist, with every out recorded via strikeout or fly ball. These parallel moments, spanning nearly five decades, showcase baseball's unique ability to weave together past and present, creating connections across generations of players and fans. From Phillips' slump-breaking cycle to Soto's power display, June 25th continues to deliver memorable performances that resonate through Mets history.

                    <description><![CDATA[June 22 stands as a pivotal date in New York Mets history, marking both the emergence of a championship contender and the farewell of a franchise icon. In 1969, Jerry Koosman led the surging Mets to a decisive 5-1 victory over the defending National League champion Cardinals at a sun-drenched Shea Stadium, foreshadowing the miraculous season ahead. Exactly eighteen years later, in 1987, Tom "The Franchise" Seaver announced his retirement, concluding a legendary 20-year career that included 311 wins, three Cy Young awards, and an enduring legacy as the heart of the Mets organization. The date also witnessed an unexpected display of power in 1977, when Claudell Washington launched three home runs at Dodger Stadium in a 9-6 victory that snapped a seven-game losing streak. This confluence of events - from the dawn of the Miracle Mets to Seaver's emotional farewell and Washington's remarkable performance - exemplifies baseball's ability to weave together moments of triumph, transition, and individual brilliance into the rich tapestry of a franchise's history.

Francisco Lindor, Brandon Nimmo, and Juan Soto electrified the baseball world with back-to-back-to-back home runs in a explosive third inning that set the tone for the evening. Nimmo and Soto each connected for two home runs, while Jared Young and Francisco Alvarez added their own solo shots to the historic tally. The performance tied an MLB record for solo home runs in a single game, last achieved in 2016. For Juan Soto, the night held special significance as he recorded his 27th multi-homer game before turning 27 years old, placing him among baseball's elite power hitters. The victory wasn't just about breaking records; it represented a potential turning point in the Mets' 2025 season, transforming a moment of adversity into a showcase of resilience and offensive prowess.

On a sweltering 90-degree afternoon at Shea Stadium in 1969, Seaver dominated the Philadelphia Phillies, retiring the first 25 batters in order before Jimmy Qualls broke up the perfect game with a clean single to left-center with one out in the ninth. The Mets won 4-0, with Seaver striking out ten in one of Shea Stadium's greatest pitching performances. Five years earlier, on June 21, 1964, the Mets and Phillies engaged in an epic 23-inning battle that remains the longest complete game in Mets history. The marathon contest lasted seven hours and twenty-three minutes, featuring seventeen pitchers who combined to throw an astounding 658 pitches. Despite the length, only seven runs were scored, with the Phillies ultimately prevailing. These historic games exemplify the perseverance and competitive spirit that have defined the Mets franchise throughout its history.

The Mets won 4-0, with Seaver striking out ten in one of Shea Stadium's greatest pitching performances. Five years earlier, on June 21, 1964, the Mets and Phillies engaged in an epic 23-inning battle that remains the longest complete game in Mets history. The marathon contest lasted seven hours and twenty-three minutes, featuring seventeen pitchers who combined to throw an astounding 658 pitches. Despite the length, only seven runs were scored, with the Phillies ultimately prevailing. These historic games exemplify the perseverance and competitive spirit that have defined the Mets franchise throughout its history.
