                    <description><![CDATA[Journey back to a sweltering June afternoon at Shea Stadium in 1969 as "The Day in Mets History" recounts Tom Seaver's near-perfect masterpiece against the Philadelphia Phillies. This gripping episode captures the electric atmosphere as 25,000 fans witnessed Seaver's dominance through eight pristine innings, with the temperature soaring past 90 degrees. The narrative builds tension with each perfect frame, culminating in Jimmy Qualls' ninth-inning single that ended the bid for perfection. The episode then transitions to another remarkable June 21st memory from 1964 - an epic 23-inning marathon between the Mets and Phillies that stands as the longest complete game in franchise history. Through vivid storytelling and rich historical detail, listeners experience these pivotal moments that helped shape Mets legacy, from Tommie Agee's decisive home run in Seaver's gem to the incredible 658 pitches thrown in the marathon contest. This episode masterfully weaves together two distinct chapters of Mets history, demonstrating how June 21st has repeatedly produced unforgettable moments that define the franchise's resilient spirit.
