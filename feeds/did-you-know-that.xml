      <description><![CDATA[In this exciting episode of "Did You Know THAT?!", we dive into the groundbreaking news of the long-awaited "Spaceballs" sequel, set to hit theaters in 2027. The episode reveals the unexpected return of Rick Moranis to Hollywood, emerging from his decades-long retirement to reprise his iconic role as Dark Helmet. We explore the rich history of the original 1987 cult classic, which despite its modest box office performance of $40 million, has become one of cinema's most beloved parodies. The discussion highlights the original film's stellar cast, including Bill Pullman, John Candy, and Mel Brooks himself, while detailing fascinating developments about the sequel's production. Notable revelations include the addition of Keke Palmer to the cast, the meaningful casting of Bill Pullman's son Lewis, and Josh Gad's involvement as both co-writer and the character of Barf Jr. The episode particularly emphasizes the significance of 98-year-old Mel Brooks returning to his role as Yogurt, keeper of "the Schwartz," and discusses how director Josh Greenbaum plans to honor the original while expanding the franchise for a new generation.

      <description><![CDATA[In this captivating episode of Did You Know THAT?!, we uncover the extraordinary journey of Wondery, from a garage startup to a billion-dollar audio empire that revolutionized digital storytelling. Founded in 2016 by former Fox executive Hernan Lopez, Wondery's commitment to immersive storytelling quickly propelled it to the forefront of the podcasting industry. The company's meteoric rise culminated in a landmark $300 million acquisition by Amazon in December 2020, but that was just the beginning. Through strategic innovations like the groundbreaking "History Tellers" educational initiative and partnerships with cultural phenomena like the Kelce brothers' "New Heights" podcast, Wondery has transformed from a podcast producer into a global media powerhouse. Their expansion into consumer products with the "Wow in the World" toy line demonstrates their versatility in cross-platform entertainment. What makes Wondery's success particularly remarkable is its perfect timing with shifting media consumption habits during the global pandemic, when their immersive audio experiences provided both escape and connection. Today, Wondery reaches an astounding 120 million monthly listeners across 150 countries, cementing its position as a pioneering force in digital media and storytelling innovation.

      <itunes:episodeType>full</itunes:episodeType>
      <description><![CDATA[In this eye-opening episode of Did You Know THAT?!, we delve into the controversial world of faith-based maternity homes, focusing on the Liberty Godparent Home in Virginia. The episode examines the striking disparity between national adoption rates for unplanned pregnancies (4%) and the significantly higher rates (30-40%) reported by some maternity homes. Following the 2023 reversal of Roe v. Wade, these facilities have experienced a 23% increase nationwide, raising important questions about their practices and influence. The investigation explores complex issues surrounding young women's reproductive choices, including controversial scholarship incentives tied to adoption placement, allegations of subtle coercion, and the isolation some residents experience. While acknowledging positive testimonials from some former residents, the episode presents a balanced examination of these institutions' practices, their impact on vulnerable young women aged 12-21, and the broader implications for family preservation during National Reunification Month. Through careful analysis of firsthand accounts and statistical anomalies, this revealing episode challenges listeners to consider the true nature of choice within these specialized residential facilities.

      <description><![CDATA[Uncover the surprising truth behind one of the most iconic dance phenomena of all time in this eye-opening episode of "Did You Know THAT?!" The Macarena, that seemingly innocent party staple that dominated the mid-90s, harbors a scandalous secret in its Spanish lyrics. While millions worldwide perfected the signature arm movements and hip shakes, few realized they were dancing to a tale of brazen infidelity. The episode delves into how this Latin pop sensation, created by Los del Río, spent an unprecedented 14 weeks atop the Billboard Hot 100 in 1996 while telling the story of a woman who cheats on her military-bound boyfriend with two of his friends. From its performance at the 1996 Democratic National Convention to its recent revival on TikTok, discover how this deceptively risqué song transcended cultural boundaries and language barriers to become a global phenomenon. Learn about its evolution from wedding dance floor favorite to protest anthem, its modern reinterpretations including CMAT's "Woke Macarena," and how new generations continue to discover its hidden meaning through social media. With over 14 million copies sold worldwide, the Macarena's journey from Spanish pop song to cultural touchstone reveals how sometimes the most popular dance crazes have the most surprising stories behind them.

      <itunes:episodeType>full</itunes:episodeType>
      <description><![CDATA[Dive into a fascinating exploration of one of the most intriguing product failures in beverage history on this episode of Did You Know THAT?! We uncover the remarkable story of Crystal Pepsi, the transparent cola that captured America's imagination in 1992 only to disappear within a year. From its inception during the "Clear Craze" of the early 90s to its spectacular Super Bowl debut featuring Van Halen's "Right Now," we trace the meteoric rise and swift fall of this innovative beverage. Learn how David Novak's bold vision for a clear, caffeine-free cola initially generated unprecedented excitement, with fans shipping six-packs across the country just to get a taste. Discover the critical missteps, including ignored warnings from food scientists about light exposure issues, and how Coca-Cola's strategic launch of Tab Clear contributed to Crystal Pepsi's downfall. The episode also reveals the product's surprising second life, driven by 90s nostalgia and passionate fan campaigns that led to limited releases in 2016, 2017, and 2022, proving that some failed products never truly die in consumer consciousness.
