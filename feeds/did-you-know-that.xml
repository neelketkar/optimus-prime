      <itunes:episodeType>full</itunes:episodeType>
      <description><![CDATA[In this eye-opening episode of Did You Know THAT?!, we dive deep into the startling reality of California's public university system - America's largest higher education network that's facing an unprecedented crisis. While celebrating record-breaking enrollment numbers with over 750,000 students across its campuses, the system grapples with a staggering $17 billion maintenance backlog. The episode reveals how the University of California and California State University systems are caught in a perfect storm of increasing student populations, deteriorating infrastructure, and looming budget cuts. From leaking roofs to failing HVAC systems, we explore how these prestigious institutions are struggling to maintain their facilities while implementing hiring freezes and facing potential funding reductions. The narrative takes an especially poignant turn as we examine how this crisis affects students paying premium tuition for substandard facilities, and parents who've invested their savings in their children's education. The episode also delves into Governor Newsom's proposed solution through public-private partnerships, particularly addressing the campus housing affordability crisis, painting a comprehensive picture of a system at a critical crossroads between growth and sustainability.

      <itunes:episodeType>full</itunes:episodeType>
      <description><![CDATA[Uncover the surprising resistance to Father's Day in this eye-opening episode of Did You Know THAT?! Journey back to the early 1900s when American fathers actively opposed the holiday that now generates $24 billion in annual spending. The episode reveals how the holiday's origins trace back to a somber 1908 commemoration of 361 fallen miners in West Virginia, before Sonora Smart Dodd's persistent advocacy in Spokane, Washington. Learn how men initially rejected the holiday as an assault on masculinity, viewing it as unnecessary sentimentality and fighting against what they perceived as commercial exploitation. Despite support from Presidents Wilson and Coolidge, Congress repeatedly rejected official recognition until 1972 when President Nixon finally signed it into law - a full 58 years after Mother's Day's official status. The episode explores this fascinating transformation from a rejected celebration to today's cultural phenomenon, where average spending reaches $196 per person, with modern trends focusing on digital greetings and sustainable gifts. Discover how those early concerns about commercialization proved prophetic, as evidenced by dramatic sales spikes in BBQ equipment and steaks during the holiday weekend.

      <description><![CDATA[Embark on a fascinating journey through California's educational legacy in this eye-opening episode of Did You Know THAT?! Discover how the University of California system, once a beacon of free public education, transformed from an ambitious experiment into a global academic powerhouse. The episode unravels the remarkable story of UC's founding vision in 1868, when California's leaders boldly committed to providing tuition-free education to state residents. Learn how this revolutionary approach to higher education helped forge modern California, producing 71 Nobel laureates and spawning technological innovations that birthed Silicon Valley. The narrative traces the system's evolution through the innovative 1960 Master Plan, which created a three-tiered approach to public higher education, and examines its profound impact on California's economic success. As the story unfolds, understand how this utopian vision of free education gradually eroded, with the introduction of fees in the 1970s evolving into today's significant tuition costs. Despite these challenges, discover why the UC system remains one of America's most successful public investments, generating approximately $10 in economic impact for every dollar invested and continuing to serve as a powerful engine of social mobility for first-generation college students.

      <description><![CDATA[Dive into a fascinating exploration of one of the most intriguing product failures in beverage history on this episode of Did You Know THAT?! We uncover the remarkable story of Crystal Pepsi, the transparent cola that captured America's imagination in 1992 only to disappear within a year. From its inception during the "Clear Craze" of the early 90s to its spectacular Super Bowl debut featuring Van Halen's "Right Now," we trace the meteoric rise and swift fall of this innovative beverage. Learn how David Novak's bold vision for a clear, caffeine-free cola initially generated unprecedented excitement, with fans shipping six-packs across the country just to get a taste. Discover the critical missteps, including ignored warnings from food scientists about light exposure issues, and how Coca-Cola's strategic launch of Tab Clear contributed to Crystal Pepsi's downfall. The episode also reveals the product's surprising second life, driven by 90s nostalgia and passionate fan campaigns that led to limited releases in 2016, 2017, and 2022, proving that some failed products never truly die in consumer consciousness.
