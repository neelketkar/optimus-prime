      <itunes:episodeType>full</itunes:episodeType>
      <description><![CDATA[In this illuminating episode of "Did You Know THAT?!", we uncover the surprising resistance to Father's Day in American history. What began as Sonora Smart Dodd's heartfelt tribute to her single father in 1909 faced unexpected opposition from its intended honorees. Early 20th-century men viewed the holiday with skepticism, considering it an affront to their masculinity and a commercial ploy. The episode reveals how the Great Depression unexpectedly saved the celebration when retailers formed the Father's Day Council, transforming it into a significant commercial event. Despite its rocky start, Father's Day didn't receive official national recognition until 1972, decades after Mother's Day. Today, the holiday represents a $24 billion economic phenomenon, with remarkable increases in BBQ and steak sales. The evolution of Father's Day reflects changing perspectives on masculinity and fatherhood, as modern dads embrace both provider and nurturer roles. This fascinating journey from rejection to celebration illustrates how cultural attitudes toward fatherhood and masculine identity have transformed over the past century.

      <itunes:episodeType>full</itunes:episodeType>
      <description><![CDATA[In this illuminating episode of Did You Know THAT?!, we delve into the extraordinary life of St. Timothy, one of early Christianity's most influential yet initially controversial leaders. From his unique mixed heritage as the son of a Jewish mother and Greek father to his transformation from a timid youth into a courageous church leader, Timothy's journey exemplifies remarkable dedication and faith. The episode reveals how this young man from Lystra underwent a dramatic physical commitment to join Paul's missionary work, eventually becoming his most trusted companion and the first bishop of Ephesus. Despite his natural timidity, which Paul frequently addressed in his letters, Timothy grew into a powerful spiritual leader who fearlessly guided early Christian communities. His story reaches a powerful climax with his martyrdom in 93 AD, when he stood firmly against pagan festivities honoring Diana, ultimately sacrificing his life for his beliefs. This fascinating narrative not only illuminates a crucial period in Christian history but also demonstrates how personal conviction and mentorship can transform an unlikely candidate into a revered religious figure whose influence continues to resonate across multiple Christian denominations today.

      <description><![CDATA[Explore the fascinating evolution of America's most ambitious public education experiment in this eye-opening episode of Did You Know THAT?! Journey through the remarkable history of California's university system, from its revolutionary tuition-free beginnings in 1868 to its current challenges. Learn how the University of California system, initially established in Oakland before moving to Berkeley, operated without charging tuition for nearly a century, embodying a visionary commitment to accessible education. Discover the groundbreaking 1960 Master Plan that created a three-tiered higher education system, transforming California into a global academic powerhouse. The episode delves into the system's gradual transformation, examining how financial pressures led to the introduction of fees in the 1960s and eventual tuition implementation. Despite facing modern challenges including a $9.1 billion maintenance backlog and rising tuition costs, the UC system remains a powerful force for social mobility, with five campuses ranking among the nation's top 10 for elevating low-income students to financial success. This compelling narrative reveals how California's grand educational experiment, while changed from its original vision, continues to shape American higher education and social progress.
