      <itunes:episodeType>full</itunes:episodeType>
      <description><![CDATA[In this sobering episode of Mets Report, we dive deep into the aftermath of a devastating series sweep by the Tampa Bay Rays, culminating in a 9-0 Father's Day defeat at Citi Field. The episode meticulously analyzes Griffin Canning's control struggles, highlighted by five costly walks that transformed the second inning into a nightmare scenario. With their NL East lead dwindling to 2.5 games over Philadelphia, the Mets face a critical stretch against division rivals Atlanta and Philadelphia. The discussion examines concerning trends in the rotation, particularly the regression of Megill and Canning, who've posted a troubling 5.63 ERA since mid-May. While Juan Soto continues to perform, Brett Baty's promising homer is overshadowed by subsequent groin discomfort, adding to the team's challenges. The analysis explores the implications of this sweep as the Mets prepare to face Atlanta's formidable pitching trio of Schwellenbach, Sale, and Strider, while maintaining perspective on their overall strong season position despite recent setbacks.
