                <description><![CDATA[In this sobering episode of Mets Report, we dive deep into the aftermath of a devastating Father's Day sweep by the Tampa Bay Rays at Citi Field, where the Mets suffered a crushing 9-0 defeat in the series finale. The episode unpacks Griffin Canning's troubling start (4.2 innings, 7 earned runs) and the broader implications for the Mets' rotation struggles. Despite maintaining their first-place position with a 41-25 record, the podcast examines how the Rays' dominant performance - outscoring the Mets 21-4 across the series - has exposed concerning vulnerabilities in the team's makeup. The discussion weaves personal narrative with analytical insight, touching on the emotional weight of watching such a defeat on Father's Day, while contextualizing the loss within the larger framework of the Mets' 2025 season. Shane Baz's masterful performance limiting the Mets to just five hits is dissected, while the episode concludes with a forward-looking perspective on the upcoming Brewers series and the resilience that has characterized the team throughout the season.
