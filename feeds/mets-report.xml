                    <description><![CDATA[In this sobering episode of Mets Report, we dive deep into the aftermath of a challenging three-game sweep by the Atlanta Braves, culminating in a decisive 7-1 loss in the series finale. Spencer Strider continued his dominance against the Mets, delivering another masterclass performance with 8 strikeouts through six innings, bringing his impressive total to 21 strikeouts in his last 12 frames. The game's pivotal moment came in the fourth inning when Matt Olson's bases-clearing double effectively sealed the Mets' fate. This loss extends the team's current skid to six games, their longest losing streak of the 2025 season. Despite the mounting frustration, the episode draws inspiring parallels to historic Mets comebacks, including the legendary 1969 Miracle Mets and the "Ya Gotta Believe" team of 1973, offering a glimmer of hope for fans. Looking ahead, the podcast previews a crucial three-game series against the Marlins, presenting an opportunity for the team to reverse their fortunes and rediscover their winning form.
