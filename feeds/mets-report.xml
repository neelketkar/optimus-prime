                    <description><![CDATA[In this sobering episode of Mets Report, we dive deep into the aftermath of a challenging three-game sweep by the Atlanta Braves, culminating in a decisive 7-1 loss in the series finale. The episode breaks down Spencer Strider's dominant performance, who continued his mastery over the Mets with 8 strikeouts through 6 innings, bringing his impressive total to 21 strikeouts in his last 12 frames. Matt Olson's pivotal three-run double in the fourth inning proved to be the decisive blow, effectively shutting down any Mets momentum. As the team grapples with their longest losing streak of the season at six games, the podcast draws inspiring parallels to historic Mets comebacks, including the legendary 1969 Miracle Mets and the "Ya Gotta Believe" team of 1973. Looking ahead, the episode previews a crucial three-game series against the Miami Marlins, presenting an opportunity for the Mets to reverse their fortunes and rediscover their winning form.
