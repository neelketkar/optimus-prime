      <description><![CDATA[In this sobering episode of Mets Report, we dive deep into the aftermath of a devastating 9-0 loss to the Tampa Bay Rays, completing a demoralizing three-game sweep at Citi Field. The Father's Day matchup highlighted glaring issues within the Mets' roster, as Shane Baz and the Rays' pitching staff completely neutralized the home team's offense, limiting them to just five scattered singles. Griffin Canning's troubling performance on the mound (4 innings, 6 earned runs) raises serious questions about the rotation's stability beyond Senga and Quintana. The episode analyzes Jose Caballero's unexpected offensive explosion, going 3-for-4 with a homer and four RBIs, symbolizing the Mets' recent struggles against seemingly beatable opponents. While the team remains in Wild Card contention, this series exposed critical weaknesses in both pitching depth and offensive consistency, with just four runs scored across three games. The discussion explores potential solutions, from minor league callups to possible trades, as the team faces another tough test with the Philadelphia Phillies arriving for an important divisional matchup. Despite the current struggles, the episode maintains perspective on the long season ahead while acknowledging the urgent need for adjustments.

      <itunes:episodeType>full</itunes:episodeType>
      <description><![CDATA[In this strategic preview episode of Orange and Blue Review, we dive deep into the upcoming three-game series between the NL East-leading New York Mets (45-27) and the struggling Miami Marlins (28-41) at Citi Field. The surging Mets, fresh off a successful series win against the Rays, look to capitalize on a favorable matchup against a Marlins squad that's been underwhelming in 2025. We analyze the probable pitching matchups, featuring the Mets' formidable rotation of Kodai Senga, Luis Severino, and Sean Manaea against Miami's likely combination of Cal Quantrill and Edward Cabrera. Special attention is paid to the Marlins' former ace Sandy Alcantara's surprising decline (3-7, 7.14 ERA) and the Mets' offensive momentum, highlighted by Brandon Nimmo's 12-game hitting streak and Francisco Alvarez's emergence as a powerful presence behind the plate. With the Mets holding a commanding fourteen-game lead over the Braves and three games over the Phillies, this series presents a prime opportunity to strengthen their position atop the division as they chase their first 98-win season since 2006.
