                    <description><![CDATA[The Atlanta Braves completed a decisive three-game sweep of the New York Mets with a commanding 7-1 victory, extending the Mets' losing streak to six games. Spencer Strider continued his dominance over the Mets, delivering a masterful performance with eight strikeouts through six innings, marking his third consecutive strong start. The game's pivotal moment came in the fourth inning when Matt Olson broke it open with a bases-clearing three-run double that effectively sealed the Mets' fate. The loss highlighted the Mets' ongoing offensive struggles and marked their longest losing streak of the 2025 season. Despite the challenging stretch, historical perspective offers hope, recalling the legendary comebacks of the 1969 and 1973 Mets teams. As the team looks to reverse their fortunes, they head into a crucial three-game series against the Miami Marlins with an opportunity to regain momentum and demonstrate their resilience.
