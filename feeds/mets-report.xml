                <description><![CDATA[In this sobering episode of Mets Report, we dive deep into the aftermath of a challenging Father's Day series sweep by the Tampa Bay Rays, marking the Mets' first series sweep of the 2025 season. The episode dissects the painful 9-0 shutout that highlighted the team's offensive struggles, managing only five hits against Shane Baz and the dominant Rays pitching staff.

Despite the disappointing performance, the discussion maintains hope for a turnaround as the team prepares to face the Milwaukee Brewers, embodying the eternal Mets mantra of "Ya Gotta Believe" even in the face of adversity.
