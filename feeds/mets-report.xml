      <description><![CDATA[In this sobering episode of Mets Report, we dive deep into the aftermath of a devastating series sweep by the Tampa Bay Rays, culminating in a 9-0 Father's Day defeat at Citi Field. The episode dissects Griffin Canning's troubling performance, where he surrendered seven earned runs and three home runs over five innings, highlighting the growing concerns about the Mets' rotation stability. The analysis explores the team's offensive struggles against elite pitching, managing just five hits against Shane Baz and the Rays' bullpen. While maintaining perspective on the Mets' overall position above .500 and their wild card contention, the episode examines critical areas needing improvement, particularly the rotation depth beyond Senga and Peterson. Special attention is paid to the red-hot Rays, who've won 18 of their last 24 games, including standout performances from Jose Caballero. The discussion concludes with a look ahead to the upcoming Marlins series, addressing the necessary adjustments Buck Showalter and the team must make to regain their competitive edge.
