                    <description><![CDATA[Dive into a fascinating exploration of National Eat Your Vegetables Day on this episode of Everyday's a Something, where presidential politics meets nutritional science. From George H.W. Bush's famous broccoli ban on Air Force One to the surprising origins in World War II Victory Gardens, discover how this health-conscious holiday intersects with American history. Learn why children's natural vegetable skepticism served as an evolutionary advantage and explore groundbreaking research from the Council for Retirement Security revealing how vegetable consumption significantly impacts independence in later years. The episode weaves together historical anecdotes, including the story of young George Bush's dinner table standoff, with modern celebrations like Seattle's innovative "Veggie Speed Dating" event. Understanding that it takes 8-15 exposures for children to accept new vegetables provides valuable context for parents and caregivers, while the episode's exploration of Victory Gardens - which inspired 20 million Americans to grow their own produce - demonstrates how national crisis can transform our relationship with healthy eating.

                    <description><![CDATA[Dive into the fascinating origins of National Splurge Day in this captivating episode of Everyday's a Something, where we uncover the story behind America's official day of guilt-free indulgence. Created by Chicago's eccentric lifestyle guru Adrienne Sioux Koopersmith in 1994, this unique holiday challenges our perceptions of self-care and personal spending. From the historic lines outside Bergdorf's to modern-day celebrations, we explore how this holiday has evolved from a simple permission slip for luxury purchases into a broader conversation about meaningful indulgence. Learn why 78% of Americans now prefer experiential splurges over material goods, and how major retailers like Nordstrom and Saks have embraced the holiday with luxury discounts. The episode delves into the concept of "mindful splurging" and examines how different people interpret the art of treating themselves - whether it's an expensive handbag, a premium coffee, or a memorable weekend getaway. Through expert insights and cultural analysis, we reveal how this quirky holiday has become a powerful reminder that sometimes the best investment is in our own happiness, proving that Koopersmith's mission to normalize guilt-free pleasure continues to resonate in today's world.
