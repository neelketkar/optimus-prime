                <description><![CDATA[In this landmark episode of Wack Pack Stories, we dive deep into the extraordinary debut of Howard Stern Show legend Beetlejuice on July 14, 1999. Born Lester Green, this charismatic performer with dwarfism and microcephaly would become the most quoted and beloved Wack Packer in the show's history. The episode chronicles how talent manager Sean Rooney discovered Beetle performing on the streets of Jersey and brought him to the Howard Stern Show, where magic instantly struck. Dressed in a miniature pimp suit and armed with his infectious grin, Beetlejuice captivated audiences with his uniquely confident yet hilariously inaccurate responses, claiming to be "six foot seven" and "two hundred and fifty pounds." His inaugural appearance sparked an entertainment legacy spanning over two decades, including a triumphant 2021 return after a five-year hiatus and a surprise appearance during David Spade's interview. This episode of Wack Pack Stories not only captures the birth of a Howard Stern Show icon but also celebrates the unpredictable charm and enduring appeal of a performer who truly embodies his own catchphrase: "as bad as can."
