                    <description><![CDATA[Journey into the chaotic world of radio's most notorious personalities in this gripping episode of Wack Pack Stories, where we unravel the complex web of feuds that shaped Howard Stern Show history. From the infamous 1994 pastrami sandwich showdown between Elegant Elliot Offen and High Pitch Erik at a New York City deli to the recent explosive karaoke battle involving Tan Mom and Medicated Pete's families, this episode peels back the layers of these legendary confrontations. Discover how seemingly trivial disputes - like Beetlejuice and Elegant Elliot's boxing rivalry - often masked deeper struggles for Howard's attention and Wack Pack hierarchy. Through unscripted, raw encounters that would rival any Shakespeare drama, these feuds have not only defined relationships but also created unexpected alliances within radio's most dysfunctional family. Fred the Elephant Boy's wisdom rings true as we explore how these conflicts, far from mere entertainment, represent the authentic, messy bonds that make the Wack Pack a unique cultural phenomenon. From sandwich disputes to karaoke competitions, each confrontation adds another chapter to the untamed legacy of these unforgettable personalities.

                    <description><![CDATA[In this revealing episode of Wack Pack Stories, we explore the controversial cancellation of Howard Stern's groundbreaking Channel 9 show in 1992, a television phenomenon that dominated New York City's late-night ratings. Despite outperforming both Johnny Carson and David Letterman, this uncensored variety show met an untimely end that sparked fan protests and industry debate. The episode delves into the real reasons behind the show's demise, dispelling the official "production costs" narrative while examining the complex interplay of corporate politics, advertiser pressure, and Stern's unwavering commitment to pushing boundaries. From the infamous "Homeless Shopping Spree" to contestants dressed as chickens on "Win Fred's Money," the show's revolutionary approach to entertainment gave voice to unconventional personalities while consistently delivering unprecedented ratings. Through interviews and archival footage, we uncover how this cancellation paradoxically launched Stern into an even more successful partnership with E! Entertainment Television, proving that authentic, boundary-pushing content will always find its audience, regardless of network resistance.

Despite standing at just three feet three inches tall, Hank delivered a masterclass in music knowledge that left the self-proclaimed audiophile Dell'Abate stunned. The contest, which took place on April 25, 2001, became an instant classic as Hank dominated the seven-round challenge, identifying obscure tracks from artists like Depeche Mode and Deep Purple within mere notes. This David-versus-Goliath battle showcased Hank's extraordinary musical expertise and proved that true knowledge knows no physical bounds. The episode not only captures the electric atmosphere of that historic morning but also serves as a touching tribute to Hank, who passed away just months later in September 2001. Through expert storytelling and carefully preserved audio, this installment of Wack Pack Stories immortalizes a moment that perfectly encapsulates the unpredictable magic of the Howard Stern Show, while celebrating the remarkable legacy of one of its most beloved characters.

What began as a seemingly one-sided challenge evolved into an iconic moment of radio history when the unlikely underdog, Hank, armed with his encyclopedic music knowledge and trademark beer can, systematically dismantled Baba Booey's reputation as the show's music expert. The episode captures the electric atmosphere as Hank correctly identified obscure B-sides, prog rock deep cuts, and even a rare Beatles outtake, ultimately crushing Gary with a decisive 7-2 victory. This David versus Goliath story exemplifies the unpredictable magic of the Stern Show universe, where a three-foot-eleven professional drunk could humble the show's executive producer through sheer musical expertise. The confrontation, punctuated by Hank's slurred yet triumphant declaration "Who's the expert NOW, monkey boy?" remains a testament to the show's ability to create unprecedented moments of entertainment while showcasing the remarkable depths of its most colorful characters.

High Pitch Erik, known for his glass-shattering falsetto that defined his presence for over two decades, undergoes a remarkable metamorphosis in 2025.

This episode chronicles Erik's fascinating evolution from his 1996 debut through his most memorable moments, including his infamous Kelly Clarkson superfan episode, his ambitious acting aspirations for Blue Bloods, and his legendary feud with Fred the Elephant Boy. Through archival clips and recent interviews, we explore how Erik's authenticity and unscripted personality made him a standout figure in the Wack Pack pantheon. From his questionable stint impersonating a police officer to his viral transformation video that captured thousands of likes, this episode celebrates the enduring legacy of a man whose story proves that genuine character transcends any vocal register.

                    <description><![CDATA[In this transformative episode of Wack Pack Stories, we delve into the remarkable metamorphosis of High Pitch Erik, one of the Howard Stern Show's most iconic Wack Pack members. Known for his distinctive squealing voice and larger-than-life presence, Erik's 2025 transformation shocked and captivated longtime listeners. Following a rehabilitation stint for a fractured femur, Erik emerged with not only a dramatically different voice - several octaves lower than his trademark high-pitched squeal - but also a significantly slimmer physique. The episode chronicles this unexpected journey, from the initial April 2nd phone call that left Howard and his audience stunned, to the May 7th in-studio appearance that confirmed the authenticity of his transformation. Through archival clips and personal narratives, we explore how this beloved Stern Show personality maintained his endearing character while undergoing a physical metamorphosis that garnered over 6,600 likes on social media. The episode beautifully captures the essence of Wack Pack magic, proving that while voices may change and weights may drop, the heart of what makes these characters special remains wonderfully intact.

                    <description><![CDATA[Dive into the untold story of late-night television's most controversial experiment in this riveting episode of Wack Pack Stories. In 1990, Howard Stern's Channel Nine show emerged as a groundbreaking force that would reshape the landscape of entertainment television forever. From its tumultuous beginnings, where WWOR executives battled with Stern over creative control, to its unprecedented success in beating Johnny Carson's ratings in New York, this episode unravels the fascinating history of a show that dared to be different. Through firsthand accounts and behind-the-scenes revelations, we explore how a low-budget production from Secaucus, New Jersey, featuring strippers reading news and unforgettable characters like Fred the Elephant Boy, became the unexpected blueprint for modern reality television. The episode delves into the show's innovative use of the seven-second delay, its raw, unfiltered approach to entertainment, and the ultimate reasons behind its short but impactful 69-episode run. Discover how this boundary-pushing program not only challenged traditional television norms but also laid the groundwork for future hit shows like Jersey Shore and Keeping Up with the Kardashians, cementing its place in entertainment history.

                    <description><![CDATA[In this unforgettable episode of Wack Pack Stories, we revisit one of the Howard Stern Show's most legendary showdowns: the 2001 rock-n-roll trivia contest between Hank the Angry Drunken Dwarf and Gary Dell'Abate. What seemed like a predictable victory for the show's executive producer and renowned music expert turned into an jaw-dropping upset that Stern fans still talk about decades later. Despite being three drinks deep, Hank's encyclopedic knowledge of music history shone through as he dominated the ten-question challenge, ultimately crushing Gary with a decisive 8-2 victory. The episode masterfully captures the electric atmosphere in the studio as the unlikely underdog systematically dismantled the reputation of "Baba Booey," proving that sometimes the most profound musical expertise can come from the most unexpected sources. Through vivid storytelling and authentic audio clips, this installment of Wack Pack Stories preserves a moment that perfectly encapsulates the unpredictable magic of the Stern Show, where conventional wisdom gets turned on its head and legends are born in the most surprising ways.

                    <description><![CDATA[In this landmark episode of Wack Pack Stories, we dive deep into the extraordinary debut of Howard Stern Show legend Beetlejuice on July 14, 1999. Born Lester Green, this charismatic performer with dwarfism and microcephaly would become the most quoted and beloved Wack Packer in the show's history. The episode chronicles how talent manager Sean Rooney discovered Beetle performing on the streets of Jersey and brought him to the Howard Stern Show, where magic instantly struck. Dressed in a miniature pimp suit and armed with his infectious grin, Beetlejuice captivated audiences with his uniquely confident yet hilariously inaccurate responses, claiming to be "six foot seven" and "two hundred and fifty pounds." His inaugural appearance sparked an entertainment legacy spanning over two decades, including a triumphant 2021 return after a five-year hiatus and a surprise appearance during David Spade's interview. This episode of Wack Pack Stories not only captures the birth of a Howard Stern Show icon but also celebrates the unpredictable charm and enduring appeal of a performer who truly embodies his own catchphrase: "as bad as can."

                    <description><![CDATA[In this poignant episode of Wack Pack Stories, we explore the unforgettable first appearance of Crackhead Bob on The Howard Stern Show in November 1995. Born George Harvey, Bob's distinctive speech pattern, marked by his famous "tippity tye tye" catchphrase, emerged from a stroke caused by crack cocaine use. What could have been a moment of cruel mockery instead became a testament to the show's unique ability to find humanity in unexpected places. Howard Stern's genuine fascination with Bob's story and personality transformed him from a random caller into a beloved Wack Pack legend. The episode delves into how Bob's candid honesty about his past, coupled with his remarkable ability to laugh at himself, endeared him to millions of listeners. His attempts at phrases like "I want to go to Disney World" became iconic drops, while his incomprehensible yet entertaining impersonations of fellow Wack Packers showcased his natural comedic talent. Beyond the laughs, this episode reveals the deeper connection Bob formed with the show's crew, highlighting how The Howard Stern Show often found heart in seemingly unlikely places. Though Bob passed away in 2016 at age 56, his impact on the show's history and his journey from addiction to radio fame remains an inspiring testament to redemption and authenticity.

                    <description><![CDATA[In this poignant episode of Wack Pack Stories, we explore the tragic final chapter of Joey Boots, the beloved Howard Stern Show personality known for his iconic "Baba Booey" catchphrase. Born Joseph Bassolino, Joey transformed live news broadcast interruptions into performance art, becoming a legendary figure in the Stern Show universe. The episode delves into the events of December 23, 2016, when fellow Wack Packer High Pitch Erik made the heartbreaking discovery in Joey's Bronx apartment. Beyond his public persona, Joey was a multifaceted character - a Vietnam veteran who bravely came out as gay on air, and a loyal friend whose sudden departure left an irreplaceable void in the Stern Show family. Through intimate details and firsthand accounts, this episode paints a touching portrait of Joey's impact on the show's culture and his deep friendship with High Pitch Erik, while sensitively addressing the circumstances of his untimely death from an accidental heroin overdose. The narrative serves as both a celebration of Joey's larger-than-life personality and a sobering reminder about the importance of checking on those close to us.

                    <description><![CDATA[Dive into one of the Howard Stern Show's most notorious chapters as Wack Pack Stories examines the tumultuous saga of Benjy Bronk's studio banishment. This episode unravels the events of October 26, 2016, when a mere ten-minute tardiness ended Benjy's two-decade run in the studio. As a key writer for Howard Stern, Benjy's chronic lateness created a complex dynamic that perfectly encapsulates the show's unique blend of professional chaos and dysfunctional family dynamics. From crashing NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell's press conference to his legendary Los Angeles meltdowns, the episode explores how Benjy's unpredictable behavior both enriched and complicated the show's atmosphere. Through detailed accounts and archival clips, we examine the pattern of lateness, Howard's escalating frustrations, and Benjy's infamous circular explanations that became a signature element of the show's DNA. This fascinating deep dive reveals how even after his studio ban, Benjy's distinctive presence continued to influence the show's narrative, demonstrating the unique ecosystem that made the Howard Stern Show a cultural phenomenon.

                    <description><![CDATA[In this unforgettable episode of Wack Pack Stories, we revisit the legendary April 25, 2001 rock-n-roll trivia showdown between Hank the Angry Drunken Dwarf and Howard Stern Show executive producer Gary Dell'Abate. Despite his diminutive stature and perpetually inebriated state, Hank demonstrated an encyclopedic knowledge of music that left even the most dedicated audiophiles in awe. The episode chronicles how this unlikely challenger, standing at just three feet ten inches tall, systematically dismantled the musical credibility of Gary "Baba Booey" Dell'Abate, whose extensive vinyl collection and industry experience proved no match for Hank's remarkable expertise. From obscure Yardbirds trivia to deep Beatles knowledge, Hank's commanding performance turned what many expected to be a comedic bit into a stunning display of musical mastery. The story culminates with Hank's decisive victory, foreshadowing his later impressive showing against Rock and Roll Jeopardy champion Mark McGrath. This classic Stern Show moment not only solidified Hank's status as a Wack Pack legend but also proved that extraordinary talent can come in the most unexpected packages.

                    <description><![CDATA[In this poignant episode of Wack Pack Stories, we explore the lasting legacy of Jackie "The Joke Man" Martling, the legendary head writer and performer from The Howard Stern Show who passed away at 77. From his humble beginnings at McGuire's Comedy Club in Bohemia, Long Island, to becoming an integral part of radio's most controversial morning show, Jackie's journey epitomized the raw, unfiltered spirit of radio's golden age. His signature machine-gun laugh and rapid-fire joke delivery style became synonymous with the show's rise to prominence during his tenure from 1983 to 2001. The episode delves deep into the complex dynamics that led to his departure, exploring how contract negotiations and creative differences with Howard Stern resulted in one of radio's most talked-about exits. Through intimate details and behind-the-scenes stories, we examine how Jackie's post-Stern life became a testament to both his resilience and the bittersweet nature of fame, culminating in his final reflective TV appearance where he mused about regrets and legacy. This compelling narrative captures the essence of a comedy pioneer whose influence on radio entertainment remains indelible.

On April 25, 2001, the three-foot-two-inch Wack Pack legend walked into K-Rock's New York studio and challenged the show's resident music expert to a battle of rock knowledge that would become iconic Stern Show lore. What unfolded was an extraordinary display of musical expertise as Hank, despite his inebriated state, demonstrated encyclopedic knowledge of rock history, from obscure B-sides to detailed band member chronologies. The pinnacle came when Hank flawlessly recited The Who's Keith Moon's recording history and named all original Guns N' Roses members while Dell'Abate struggled to keep pace. This episode captures the essence of what made the Stern Show special - those unexpected moments when conventional wisdom gets turned on its head, proving that expertise can come from the most unlikely sources. The showdown remains a testament to the show's unpredictable nature and its ability to create radio magic from spontaneous moments.

                    <itunes:episodeType>full</itunes:episodeType>
                    <description><![CDATA[In this unforgettable episode of Wack Pack Stories, we revisit one of The Howard Stern Show's most legendary moments - Gary Dell'Abate's infamous love tape, which marks its 20th anniversary. The episode delves deep into the cringe-worthy footage from 1999, where Gary "Baba Booey" Dell'Abate recorded what was meant to be a private message of devotion to his girlfriend. What followed became radio history, as the tape - featuring Gary's awkward bedroom monologue, complete with monkey faces, amateur singing, and the immortal line "You're the wind beneath my wings" - found its way into Howard Stern's hands. The seven-minute VHS recording sparked months of on-air parodies, dramatic readings, and celebrity reactions that cemented its place in Stern Show lore. The episode explores how this moment of pure vulnerability, rather than diminishing Gary's reputation, endeared him further to fans who recognized their own romantic mishaps in his earnest attempt at expressing love. Through archival clips, behind-the-scenes stories, and Gary's own retrospective commentary during the 2019 anniversary special, this episode captures both the hilarity and humanity of one of radio's most memorable moments.
