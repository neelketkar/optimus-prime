                <description><![CDATA[Step into the world of radio history as Wack Pack Stories chronicles the unforgettable moment when Eric Lynch, better known as Eric the Actor, first graced the Howard Stern Show airwaves on September 19, 2002. What began as a passionate defense of American Idol winner Kelly Clarkson evolved into an eleven-year saga that would define an era of the show. Standing at just three feet tall and speaking with his distinctive high-pitched voice, Eric's initial call sparked a legendary run that would see him become the show's most prolific caller. Despite his physical limitations, Eric's larger-than-life personality, unrelenting feuds with fellow show personalities, and steadfast refusal to acknowledge his Wack Pack status made him an irreplaceable figure in the Stern Show universe. From his notorious Twitter controversies to his ambitious acting pursuits, Eric's unfiltered authenticity stood out in an industry often criticized for manufactured content. His decade-plus journey on the show, tragically cut short by his passing in 2014 at age 39, left an indelible mark on radio entertainment history, proving that sometimes the most impactful voices come from the most unexpected sources.

                <description><![CDATA[Step into the fascinating world of Howard Stern Show history as Wack Pack Stories chronicles the legendary first appearance of Beetlejuice, arguably the greatest Wack Packer of all time. On July 14, 1999, Lester Green - standing at just 4'3" tall - walked into the K-Rock studio and unknowingly changed radio history forever. Originally accompanying promoter Frank "Third Degree" Burns for a dwarf-tossing segment, Beetlejuice immediately captured Howard's attention with his larger-than-life personality and unintentionally hilarious claims, including being 6'5" tall and able to knock out Mike Tyson. His authentic, unfiltered responses and infectious laugh instantly marked him as "radio gold," with Howard declaring him a "once in a lifetime guest" on that very first day. This pivotal episode explores how Beetle's debut appearance launched an incredible career spanning hundreds of Stern Show appearances, DVD releases, celebrity collaborations, and merchandise lines. From his outlandish claim of bench-pressing 500 pounds to becoming the self-proclaimed "bad as can" king of the Wack Pack, this episode delves into the origin story of a true Howard Stern Show legend whose 2021 return after a five-year hiatus proved his enduring impact on the show's legacy.

                <description><![CDATA[In this poignant episode of Wack Pack Stories, we explore the unforgettable debut of Crackhead Bob on The Howard Stern Show, a moment that would forever change radio history. On November 7, 1995, George Harvey's distinctive voice first graced the K-Rock airwaves, marking the beginning of a legendary run that would span decades. Despite speech difficulties resulting from a cocaine-induced stroke, Bob's determination to communicate and his signature phrase "tippie tai tippie tai" instantly captured audiences' hearts. The episode reveals Bob's lesser-known background as a successful Seattle businessman whose life took a dramatic turn after a five-year battle with crack addiction. What set Bob apart in the Wack Pack pantheon was his remarkable self-awareness and ability to transform personal tragedy into entertainment gold, from his memorable Chinese food orders to his attempted weather reports. His story represents the perfect blend of comedy and humanity that defined The Howard Stern Show's golden era. Through intimate details and behind-the-scenes insights, this episode pays tribute to a man who, despite his challenges, brought joy to millions until his untimely passing in 2016 at age 56, leaving an indelible mark on radio history and popular culture.
