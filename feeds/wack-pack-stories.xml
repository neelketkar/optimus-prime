      <description><![CDATA[In this landmark episode of Wack Pack Stories, we revisit the historic moment that introduced one of the Howard Stern Show's most iconic characters. On September 19th, 2002, a high-pitched, defiant voice belonging to Eric Lynch first crackled through the airwaves, defending American Idol winner Kelly Clarkson and unwittingly launching a 12-year saga that would captivate millions. Standing at 3'5" tall and living with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, Eric's initial call transformed from a heated defense of his idol into radio gold as the Stern crew discovered his crush on actress Beverley Mitchell and his adamant refusal to be labeled a "midget." What followed was over a decade of unforgettable radio moments, from his notorious negotiations for appearances to legendary feuds with staff members. Eric's authenticity and unwavering personality made him a standout character in the Stern Show universe - never playing along, never compromising, and always remaining defiantly himself. His legacy, cut short by his passing in 2014 at age 39, lives on through countless memorable interactions, catchphrases, and moments that defined an era of radio entertainment.

Standing at just 4'3" but claiming to be 6'7", Lester "Beetlejuice" Green burst onto the airwaves with an unforgettable introduction that would mark the beginning of a 25-year legacy in radio entertainment. From his first appearance alongside Sean Rooney and Frank "Third Degree" Burns, Beetlejuice captivated audiences with his larger-than-life personality, outlandish claims of knocking out Mike Tyson, and his now-iconic catchphrases like "Coo be" and "Goo for you." Despite facing challenges with microcephaly, Beetlejuice's fearless attitude and magnetic charisma quickly established him as a cornerstone of the Wack Pack, starring in countless memorable segments from spelling bees to boxing matches. His 2021 return after a five-year hiatus sparked a social media frenzy, proving his enduring appeal even decades after his debut. Through countless appearances, celebrity encounters, and quotable moments, Beetlejuice has cemented his place as one of the most beloved figures in Howard Stern Show history, embodying the unpredictable spirit that makes the Wack Pack truly unique.

      <itunes:episodeType>full</itunes:episodeType>
      <description><![CDATA[In this poignant episode of Wack Pack Stories, we delve into the unforgettable moment when Crackhead Bob first graced the Howard Stern Show airwaves on November 7th, 1995. Born George Harvey, Bob's journey from a regular Texas resident to legendary Wack Pack status began with three memorable words: "Ticky tow mane." Following a life-altering crack cocaine overdose that left him partially paralyzed with brain damage, Bob's distinctive speech pattern initially sparked skepticism but quickly evolved into one of the show's most beloved elements. His remarkable ability to find humor in personal tragedy, combined with his genuine enthusiasm and willingness to participate in various bits - from prank calling Chinese restaurants to his memorable Channel 9 show appearances - made him an integral part of the Stern Show family. Despite the sometimes controversial nature of his segments, Bob's infectious positivity and self-awareness transformed what could have been exploitative into something unexpectedly heartwarming. His legacy, cut short by his passing in 2016 at age 56, stands as a testament to the show's unique ability to find humanity and humor in unexpected places, making him one of the most memorable characters in Howard Stern Show history.

Born George Harvey, Bob's journey from a regular Texas resident to legendary Wack Pack status began with three memorable words: "Ticky tow mane." Following a life-altering crack cocaine overdose that left him partially paralyzed with brain damage, Bob's distinctive speech pattern initially sparked skepticism but quickly evolved into one of the show's most beloved elements. His remarkable ability to find humor in personal tragedy, combined with his genuine enthusiasm and willingness to participate in various bits - from prank calling Chinese restaurants to his memorable Channel 9 show appearances - made him an integral part of the Stern Show family. Despite the sometimes controversial nature of his segments, Bob's infectious positivity and self-awareness transformed what could have been exploitative into something unexpectedly heartwarming. His legacy, cut short by his passing in 2016 at age 56, stands as a testament to the show's unique ability to find humanity and humor in unexpected places, making him one of the most memorable characters in Howard Stern Show history.
