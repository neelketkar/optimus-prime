What began with an angry defense of American Idol winner Kelly Clarkson evolved into one of the most legendary caller relationships in radio history. Standing at just three feet tall and living with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, Eric's distinctive high-pitched voice and unwavering defiance against Howard's antics quickly made him a standout personality. His steadfast refusal to embrace the "Wack Pack" label, fierce protection of his preferred name "Eric the Actor," and unfiltered interactions with the show's cast created countless memorable moments over his twelve-year run. From his passionate defense of celebrities to his infamous threats against Fred Norris, Eric's authenticity and uncompromising nature endeared him to millions of listeners. His daily calls became must-listen radio, showcasing a complex personality that transcended his physical limitations. Until his passing in 2014, Eric remained true to his convictions, earning him recognition from Rolling Stone as "the greatest Wack Packer of all time" and cementing his legacy as one of the most beloved figures in Stern Show history.

                <description><![CDATA[In this poignant episode of Wack Pack Stories, we explore the lasting legacy of Jackie "The Joke Man" Martling, whose recent passing marks the end of an era in radio history. From his humble beginnings in Long Island comedy clubs to becoming Howard Stern's quick-witted head writer, Jackie's infectious laugh and endless arsenal of jokes helped define The Howard Stern Show's golden age. The episode delves deep into Jackie's fifteen-year tenure, examining how his departure in 2001 became one of radio's most talked-about exits, forever changing the show's dynamic. Through archival clips and behind-the-scenes stories, we uncover the complex relationship between Stern and Martling, from their comedic chemistry to the contract disputes that led to their professional split. The narrative explores Jackie's post-Stern life, including his ventures on Sirius XM's The Joke Hunt and his final appearances, painting a complete picture of a comedy legend whose influence extended far beyond his famous laugh. This tribute episode captures both the humor and humanity of a man who helped pioneer the landscape of modern radio comedy, leaving an indelible mark on broadcasting history.
