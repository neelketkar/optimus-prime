                    <description><![CDATA[In this revealing episode of Wack Pack Stories, we explore the dramatic final chapter of The Howard Stern Show on WWOR Channel Nine in July 1992. From its groundbreaking success to its unexpected demise, this pivotal moment in television history marked the end of an era that had revolutionized late-night entertainment. The episode delves into how Stern's Saturday night program, which consistently dominated its 11:30 PM time slot with unprecedented ratings, ultimately succumbed not to its controversial content but to behind-the-scenes financial pressures. Through detailed storytelling, we uncover how the show's escalating production costs, combined with WWOR's financial restructuring, led to its cancellation despite massive viewership. The narrative draws fascinating parallels to Stern's earlier dismissal from WNBC radio, illustrating his career-long battle between commercial success and creative control. This episode particularly resonates in today's streaming era, highlighting how Stern's boundary-pushing content on Channel Nine pioneered the kind of unfiltered entertainment that would later become mainstream, from his outrageous Fartman appearances to his unorthodox interview style, leaving an indelible mark on television history.

In this captivating episode, we revisit April 25, 2001, when the show's beloved executive producer faced an unexpected challenger in a rock-n-roll trivia contest that would become part of Stern Show lore. Despite his diminutive stature and inebriated state, Hank demonstrated an astounding command of music knowledge, from Led Zeppelin's drum credits to David Bowie's album trivia, ultimately defeating the well-known music aficionado Baba Booey with a decisive score of eleven to seven. The episode poignantly captures both the hilarity of the moment and its bittersweet nature, as this would be one of Hank's final triumphant appearances before his passing in September 2001. Through expert storytelling and rich archival audio, Wack Pack Stories preserves this remarkable piece of radio history where an unlikely hero proved that expertise can come from the most unexpected sources, creating a moment that continues to resonate with fans of the Howard Stern Show.

                    <description><![CDATA[In this outrageous episode of Wack Pack Stories, we delve into one of The Howard Stern Show's most infamous moments - the emergence of "Ass Napkin Ed." What began as a seemingly routine call in 2009 transformed into Stern Show legend when Ed from Albany confessed his peculiar bathroom habit of using stolen restaurant napkins instead of toilet paper. Howard Stern's masterful ability to mine comedy gold from the bizarre shines through as he mercilessly dissects Ed's unconventional cleaning method, creating radio history in the process. The episode traces Ed's evolution from anonymous caller to full-fledged Wack Pack royalty, including his memorable involvement in a bizarre love triangle with High Pitch Erik and a woman named April in 2016. Through health scares and summer escapades, Ed's journey exemplifies the unique charm of the Wack Pack phenomenon - where ordinary people's extraordinary quirks become part of radio folklore. This story captures the essence of The Howard Stern Show's ability to transform everyday oddities into unforgettable entertainment, while showcasing Howard's unparalleled talent for finding humor in the most unexpected places.

                    <description><![CDATA[In this revealing episode of Wack Pack Stories, we revisit the legendary 1998 Howard Stern Show interview with John Stamos that became a defining moment in shock radio history. The Full House star's unexpected candor during his visit to Studio 6A at 645 Madison Avenue transformed what should have been a routine promotional appearance into an unforgettable broadcasting event. Howard's masterful interviewing style drew out shocking revelations about Stamos's Hollywood lifestyle, from alleged Playboy Mansion escapades to intimate details about his marriage to Rebecca Romijn. The episode contrasts this raw 1998 appearance with Stamos's more recent 2023 return to the show, where a more mature, sober Stamos reflected on his past with new perspective. Through archival audio and expert commentary, this installment captures the evolution of both Stern's interviewing prowess and Stamos's personal growth, offering listeners an intimate look at how one of radio's most memorable moments came to be and its lasting impact on pop culture history.

This episode uncovers how a routine promotional interview transformed into an unforgettable two-hour confession that would define Stern's distinctive interviewing style. What began with a visibly nervous Full House star expecting a standard press appearance evolved into a brutally honest conversation covering everything from his high-profile divorce to untold stories from his Beach Boys touring days. The episode explores how this watershed moment established the template for Stern's signature celebrity interviews, demonstrating his unique ability to strip away Hollywood pretense and extract raw, unfiltered honesty from his guests. Through archival audio and contemporary context, we examine how Stamos's unexpected candor not only earned him a place among Stern's most memorable guests but also helped establish the show's reputation as a venue for authentic celebrity conversations. The episode culminates with a look at Stamos's evolution from that nervous first guest to becoming one of Howard's most open and recurring visitors, including recent revelations from his memoir about sobriety and behind-the-scenes friendships.

                    <description><![CDATA[Journey into one of the most unforgettable moments in Howard Stern Show history as Wack Pack Stories chronicles Kenneth Keith Kallenbach's legendary 1990 Channel 9 Show debut. This episode unravels the fascinating tale of a 23-year-old aspiring comedian from Pennsylvania who transformed an unusual talent - blowing cigarette smoke through his eyes - into his ticket to Stern Show stardom. Against the electric backdrop of late-night television, viewers witness the raw, unscripted moment that would cement Kallenbach's place in the Wack Pack pantheon. The episode masterfully captures the essence of early 90s shock entertainment, when the Howard Stern Show was redefining the boundaries of broadcast television. Through detailed storytelling and archival context, we explore how this singular performance exemplified the show's unique ability to turn ordinary people with extraordinary quirks into cult celebrities. The narrative delves into the high-stakes atmosphere of the Channel 9 Show, the immediate reaction from Howard, Fred Norris, and the studio audience, and how this bizarre talent launched Kallenbach's recurring role in the Stern Show universe. This episode serves as both a time capsule of a pivotal moment in comedy history and a tribute to one of the Wack Pack's most memorable characters.

When High Pitch Erik, the notorious 400-pound Wack Packer, faced off against show veteran Sal Governale, nobody expected the verbal warfare that would unfold in the Sirius studios. The episode captures the raw energy of what became an instant classic, featuring unexpected appearances from Wack Pack royalty Beetlejuice and a shocking display of wit from High Pitch Erik himself. From Sal's biting comedy to Erik's surprisingly sharp comebacks about the infamous "143" saga, the tension builds to an unforgettable crescendo culminating in flying furniture and a frantically overworked censor button. Howard Stern himself had to intervene, declaring it the most chaotic Wack Pack moment since Elegant Elliot Offen's running man incident. This episode not only documents the pure mayhem that made the Stern Show legendary but also captures a pivotal moment in Wack Pack history, complete with behind-the-scenes details and the aftermath that led to High Pitch Erik's successful Cameo career.

From obscure Led Zeppelin deep cuts to chronological Yes lineups, Hank dominated the competition, humbling not only Dell'Abate but also guest competitor Mark McGrath of Sugar Ray fame. This episode captures the electric atmosphere as the studio erupted with each of Hank's correct answers, punctuated by Fred's merciless drops and Howard's uncontrollable laughter. Beyond the surface entertainment of Gary's embarrassment lies a powerful reminder about preconceptions and hidden talents, as a beloved Wack Pack member cemented his place in Stern Show history by proving that expertise can come in unexpected packages.

                    <description><![CDATA[In this captivating episode of Wack Pack Stories, we explore the legendary first appearance of Eric Lynch, better known as Eric the Actor, on The Howard Stern Show. On September 19, 2002, what began as a heated defense of American Idol winner Kelly Clarkson evolved into one of radio's most enduring legacies. Standing just three feet tall, Eric's distinctive high-pitched voice and unfiltered personality immediately captured Howard's attention, launching a remarkable 12-year journey that would cement his status as one of the show's most memorable characters. From his passionate crush on Beverly Mitchell to his vehement denial of being a Wack Packer, Eric's authentic and often confrontational nature created countless iconic moments. His legacy includes infamous incidents like the unrealized balloon stunt, explosive feuds with Johnny Fratto, and his steadfast refusal to embrace the nickname "Eric the Midget." Though his time was cut short at age 39 in 2014, Eric's impact on The Howard Stern Show remains unmatched, with Rolling Stone even suggesting he might have been the greatest Wack Packer of all time. This episode delves deep into the origin story of a man whose unwavering authenticity and passionate demeanor created some of the most unforgettable moments in radio history.

                    <description><![CDATA[In this revealing episode of Wack Pack Stories, we explore the groundbreaking yet short-lived Channel 9 show that revolutionized late-night television in the early 1990s. Broadcasting from WWOR's Secaucus studios, Howard Stern's foray into television represented a radical departure from conventional programming, blending the raw energy of public access with professional production values. The show's 69-episode run from 1990 to 1992 featured unprecedented content that challenged broadcasting norms, including the infamous Lesbian Dial-a-Date segments and memorable appearances by Wack Pack personalities like Fred the Elephant Boy and Gary the Retard. Despite achieving ratings that surpassed Johnny Carson in the New York market, the show's controversial content and escalating production costs ultimately led to its cancellation. However, its legacy proved instrumental in shaping Howard Stern's future television ventures, including his successful runs on the E! network and Howard TV. The Channel 9 show not only established the Wack Pack as cultural phenomena but also demonstrated Stern's ability to successfully translate his provocative radio persona to television, setting the stage for his multimedia empire and influencing the landscape of late-night entertainment for decades to come.

                    <description><![CDATA[In this revealing episode of Wack Pack Stories, we revisit one of the Howard Stern Show's most memorable interviews: John Stamos's explosive 1998 appearance. Twenty-seven years after that fateful June day, we dissect the legendary conversation that showcased Stern's unparalleled interviewing prowess and Stamos's unexpected candor. The episode delves into how the Full House star, fresh from his divorce from Rebecca Romijn, found himself in the hot seat at K-Rock studios, where what could have been a standard celebrity interview transformed into raw, unfiltered radio gold. Unlike many Hollywood stars who wilted under Stern's notorious questioning, Stamos embraced the challenge, matching the King of All Media's energy with startling revelations about his marriage, Hollywood dating experiences, and behind-the-scenes stories from his television career. The episode draws a poignant parallel to recent events, including Stamos's appearance at the Songwriters Hall of Fame, while reflecting on how this interview exemplifies the unique magic of The Howard Stern Show during its peak years. With rumors of Stern's retirement looming, this retrospective captures a pivotal moment in radio history when authenticity trumped celebrity pretense.

                    <description><![CDATA[In this poignant episode of Wack Pack Stories, we explore the tragic final chapter of Joey Boots, the beloved Howard Stern Show personality known for his iconic "Baba Booey" catchphrase that became a cultural phenomenon. The episode delves into the events of December 23, 2016, when fellow Wack Packer High Pitch Erik's growing concern led to the devastating discovery of Joey's body in his Bronx apartment. Through intimate storytelling and firsthand accounts, we examine Joey's impact on the Howard Stern Show community, his fearless approach to comedy, and his special friendship with High Pitch Erik. The narrative weaves together Joey's public persona as the "Baba Booey" bomber who interrupted countless live broadcasts with his personal struggles that ultimately led to his untimely death at age 49 from an accidental heroin overdose. Howard Stern's heartfelt tribute and Erik's emotional remembrance paint a portrait of a complex character who was more than just his on-air antics - a loyal friend and fearless performer whose absence left an irreplaceable void in the Wack Pack community. This episode serves as both a celebration of Joey Boots' legacy and a sobering reminder of the human stories behind entertainment personalities.

                    <description><![CDATA[In this unforgettable episode of Wack Pack Stories, we dive deep into one of Howard Stern Show's most memorable celebrity encounters - John Stamos's legendary 1998 appearance that became a defining moment in shock radio history. What started as a routine promotional visit for Full House reruns transformed into an raw, unfiltered conversation that stripped away Hollywood pretense and revealed the real Uncle Jesse. The episode meticulously reconstructs the electric atmosphere of the K-Rock studios as Stern, at the height of his interviewing powers, masterfully coaxed Stamos into sharing intimate details about his recent divorce from Rebecca Romijn, his adventures at the Playboy Mansion, and behind-the-scenes revelations about the Full House cast. This pivotal interview not only showcased Stern's unparalleled ability to disarm celebrities but also marked the beginning of Stamos's recurring role in the Stern Show universe, culminating in his poignant 2024 return discussing his sobriety journey. Through archival audio and expert storytelling, this episode captures the essence of late-90s shock radio while examining how one unexpected interview became a touchstone moment in both men's careers.

                    <description><![CDATA[Dive into one of The Howard Stern Show's most notorious recurring sagas in this captivating episode of Wack Pack Stories. The infamous "Late Benjy" chronicles reach their boiling point in October 2009, when writer Benjy Bronk's chronic tardiness finally pushes Howard Stern to his limit. This episode meticulously reconstructs the events leading to Benjy's memorable suspension, including his bizarre attempts to circumvent the punishment - from showing up early the next day to apologize for being late, to an ill-fated attempt to sneak back into Sirius XM disguised as a delivery person. Through firsthand accounts and archival audio, we explore how Benjy's unconventional behavior and inability to arrive on time became legendary within the Stern Show universe. The story extends beyond the 2009 incident, tracking the pattern of lateness that would eventually lead to multiple suspensions, including the notable two-week ban in 2016. This episode of Wack Pack Stories not only documents these events but also examines how Benjy's peculiar personality and unorthodox approach to his job made him an enduring, if frustrating, presence in the Stern Show's history, offering listeners an intimate look at one of the show's most colorful behind-the-scenes characters.

Despite being heavily intoxicated, the 3'10" Wack Pack legend demonstrated his extraordinary musical knowledge, defeating the show's renowned music aficionado in a best-of-seven song identification challenge. The episode captures the electric atmosphere of the K-Rock studios as Hank effortlessly identified obscure tracks from Led Zeppelin, The Who, and Aerosmith, leaving both the audience and Gary stunned. This David versus Goliath matchup showcases not only Hank's surprising expertise but also highlights one of the most humbling moments in Dell'Abate's career. The contest, which ended with Hank triumphant at 4-2, became a defining moment in Stern Show history, later validated when Hank challenged Rock and Roll Jeopardy champion Mark McGrath. This episode perfectly encapsulates the unpredictable magic that made the Howard Stern Show a cultural phenomenon, proving that sometimes the most unlikely contestants can become the most memorable champions.

                    <description><![CDATA[In this poignant episode of Wack Pack Stories, we explore the legacy of Jackie "The Joke Man" Martling, whose recent passing marks the end of an era in radio history. As a pivotal figure on The Howard Stern Show from 1986 to 2001, Jackie's distinctive cackling laugh and rapid-fire joke delivery helped shape the show's golden age. The episode delves into Jackie's fifteen-year tenure as Howard's head writer and on-air personality, examining how his contentious departure in 2001 over contract negotiations became one of radio's most memorable behind-the-scenes dramas. From his early days at K-Rock to his final performance at McGuire's Comedy Club in Bohemia, Long Island, we trace the journey of a comedian whose influence extended far beyond his infamous punch lines. The story captures both the hilarity and melancholy of Jackie's post-Stern career, including Howard's legendary on-air readings of his comedy club bookings, while celebrating the resilient spirit of a man who never lost his signature laugh even in the face of professional setbacks. Through archival clips and personal anecdotes, this tribute episode showcases why Jackie Martling remains one of the most beloved and controversial figures in radio comedy history.

What seemed like a predictable victory for the show's resident music expert turned into a jaw-dropping display of encyclopedic rock knowledge from an unlikely source. Despite his condition, Hank demonstrated an extraordinary command of music history, effortlessly identifying everything from Blue Oyster Cult deep cuts to obscure Beatles B-sides. The episode captures the electric atmosphere as Hank systematically dismantled Gary's reputation as the show's music authority, answering questions with remarkable speed and accuracy. This David versus Goliath story showcases not just a triumph of knowledge over expectations, but also highlights one of the Wack Pack's most brilliant moments. The contest culminated in a stunning display of Hank's expertise when he not only identified an obscure 1970s track but performed it perfectly, cementing his victory and creating a moment that would become part of Howard Stern Show folklore.

                    <description><![CDATA[In this poignant episode of Wack Pack Stories, we delve into a transformative moment in Howard Stern Show history as Gary Dell'Abate, the show's renowned producer, faces the emotional challenge of parting with nine hundred pieces of his cherished vinyl collection. Known affectionately as Baba Booey, Gary's identity has been intrinsically linked to his extensive record collection, which became a recurring source of entertainment and mockery on the show. The episode explores how Gary's famous "Booey Decimal System" evolved from a rigid alphabetical organization to a more personal "emotional resonance" categorization, reflecting his changing relationship with his collection. Through intimate storytelling, we uncover the significance of these vinyl records in Gary's life and their role in countless memorable Stern Show moments, from the infamous vinyl cleaning system debates to passionate discussions about original pressings versus digital alternatives. This episode not only chronicles the physical downsizing of a legendary collection but also examines themes of adaptation, letting go, and how our relationships with personal possessions evolve over time. For longtime Stern Show fans and vinyl enthusiasts alike, this story represents more than just parting with records - it's a reflection on how our attachments shape our identities and the courage it takes to embrace change.
