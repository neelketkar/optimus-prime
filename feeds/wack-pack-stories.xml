                <description><![CDATA[In this fascinating episode of Wack Pack Stories, we delve into the obsessive vinyl collecting saga of Gary Dell'Abate, better known as Baba Booey, Howard Stern Show's legendary producer. The episode uncovers the meticulous world of a true audiophile, from his infamous Booey Decimal System to the great vinyl purge of 2021 where he parted with 900 pieces of his treasured collection. Listeners will discover the extraordinary lengths Gary went to preserve his records, including detailed photography sessions, elaborate spreadsheets, and a carefully monitored temperature-controlled storage room. The story takes an intriguing turn as we learn about his collection's peak value, requiring specialized insurance documentation, and his ultimate decision to keep just 143 essential albums - his desert island collection. The episode reveals Gary's ongoing dedication to vinyl preservation, highlighted by a recent sixteen-hour reorganization session while under the influence of Ozempic. Through intimate anecdotes and Howard Stern's characteristic commentary, this installment offers an unprecedented glimpse into one of the most peculiar stories in Stern Show history, showcasing how one man's passion for vinyl transcended mere collecting to become a defining aspect of his identity.
