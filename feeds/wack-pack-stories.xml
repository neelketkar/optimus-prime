      <description><![CDATA[In this unforgettable episode of Wack Pack Stories, we revisit the momentous day when Eric the Actor first graced the Howard Stern Show airwaves. On September 19th, 2002, an unexpected call from Sacramento changed radio history forever when Eric Shaun Lynch's distinctive voice rang through to defend Kelly Clarkson. Standing at 3'5" and living with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, Eric's initial interaction sparked what would become one of the most legendary relationships in the show's history. From his adamant refusal to accept the nickname "Eric the Midget" to his passionate celebrity crushes, including Beverley Mitchell from 7th Heaven, Eric's unfiltered personality and unwavering determination made him an instant phenomenon. His recurring calls, marked by heated arguments with Howard, ambitious demands, and the infamous balloon saga, transformed him from a regular caller into a beloved Wack Pack icon. Despite his passing in 2014 at age 39, Eric's legacy endures through his memorable catchphrases, uncompromising attitude, and the indelible mark he left on the show's history. This episode captures the essence of how a simple phone call evolved into one of the most cherished chapters in Howard Stern Show history.

      <description><![CDATA[In this landmark episode of Wack Pack Stories, we delve into the extraordinary first appearance of Beetlejuice on The Howard Stern Show, a moment that would forever change radio history. On July 14, 1999, Lester Green, standing at 4'3" with microcephaly, quietly entered the studio alongside another performer from Sean Rooney's dwarf-tossing business. Despite not being the intended focus, Howard Stern's legendary instincts immediately recognized something special in Beetle. His unique personality and unpredictable responses created instant radio magic, leading Stern to declare him a "once in a lifetime guest." The episode reveals fascinating details about Beetle's debut, including actor Jerry O'Connell's surprising connection as he called in to share that Beetle was once his mother's student. From this humble beginning, Beetlejuice would go on to become a cultural phenomenon, appearing in Hollywood films, creating iconic catchphrases, and eventually being crowned the greatest Wack Packer of all time in 2015. This episode captures the essence of how an unexpected guest standing quietly in the back of the studio would become one of the most beloved figures in radio entertainment history, proving that true star power can emerge from the most unlikely sources.

      <itunes:episodeType>full</itunes:episodeType>
      <description><![CDATA[In this poignant episode of Wack Pack Stories, we delve into the unforgettable moment when George Harvey, better known as Crackhead Bob, first graced the Howard Stern Show airwaves on November 7th, 1995. From his iconic first words "Dip da dip da dip," Bob's journey from addiction survivor to beloved Wack Pack member captivated millions of listeners. After suffering a devastating stroke from crack cocaine use that left him partially paralyzed with impaired speech, Harvey transformed his tragedy into triumph through his regular appearances on the show. His distinctive speech patterns and catchphrases like "ticky tie main" became legendary, but it was his resilient spirit and good-natured personality that truly endeared him to the Stern Show audience. Rather than becoming a cautionary tale, Bob's story evolved into one of radio's most remarkable comebacks, as he became a regular fixture on the show, participating in contests and public appearances. His impact extended far beyond comedy, demonstrating how authentic human connections can emerge from the most unexpected circumstances. Though we lost Bob in 2016 at age 56, his legacy as a Wack Pack legend continues to resonate with fans, reminding us that behind every memorable character lies a story of struggle, perseverance, and ultimately, triumph.

From his iconic first words "Dip da dip da dip," Bob's journey from addiction survivor to beloved Wack Pack member captivated millions of listeners. After suffering a devastating stroke from crack cocaine use that left him partially paralyzed with impaired speech, Harvey transformed his tragedy into triumph through his regular appearances on the show. His distinctive speech patterns and catchphrases like "ticky tie main" became legendary, but it was his resilient spirit and good-natured personality that truly endeared him to the Stern Show audience. Rather than becoming a cautionary tale, Bob's story evolved into one of radio's most remarkable comebacks, as he became a regular fixture on the show, participating in contests and public appearances. His impact extended far beyond comedy, demonstrating how authentic human connections can emerge from the most unexpected circumstances. Though we lost Bob in 2016 at age 56, his legacy as a Wack Pack legend continues to resonate with fans, reminding us that behind every memorable character lies a story of struggle, perseverance, and ultimately, triumph.
