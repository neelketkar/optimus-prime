                    <description><![CDATA[Cow cuddling therapy emerges as a revolutionary wellness trend backed by compelling scientific research. At Mountain Horse Farm in Naples, New York, participants pay $400 to experience therapeutic sessions with specially trained 2,000-pound bovine companions. A groundbreaking study from Utrecht University demonstrates that these sessions can reduce stress hormone levels by an impressive 39 percent, surpassing traditional relaxation techniques. The therapy leverages the cow's natural characteristics – their 102-degree body temperature and slow heartbeat of 40-50 beats per minute – to create a unique form of deep pressure therapy. The practice has gained such legitimacy that the Netherlands has established the world's first professional cow cuddling certification program, while European insurance companies now recognize it as a legitimate treatment for anxiety and depression. Mountain Horse Farm has expanded their offerings to include sunset cuddle sessions, where guests can experience this innovative therapy while watching the sun set.
