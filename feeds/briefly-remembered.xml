      <itunes:title>The Second Pick: David Greenwood&apos;s Untold Legacy</itunes:title>
      <itunes:episodeType>full</itunes:episodeType>
      <description><![CDATA[In this poignant episode of Briefly Remembered, we explore the legacy of David Greenwood, the former Chicago Bulls forward who recently passed away at 68. From his pivotal decision to honor his UCLA commitment after John Wooden's departure to his impressive NBA career spanning multiple teams, Greenwood's story embodies the essence of professional basketball in the pre-social media era. As the second overall pick in the 1979 NBA draft, following Magic Johnson, Greenwood left an indelible mark on the sport, averaging 16.3 points and 9.4 rebounds in his rookie season with the Bulls. His collegiate career at UCLA was equally remarkable, finishing 15th in all-time scoring and fourth in rebounds - a testament to his skill in a program that produced legends like Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Bill Walton. Beyond his playing career, Greenwood's impact continued as he led Verbum Dei High School to consecutive state championships as a coach. His journey culminated in an NBA championship with the Detroit Pistons' "Bad Boys" in 1990, but his true legacy lies in the quiet dignity and unwavering professionalism he brought to the game, representing an era when character and consistency meant more than headlines.

      <itunes:episodeType>full</itunes:episodeType>
      <description><![CDATA[In this poignant episode of Briefly Remembered, we explore the life and tragic end of Melissa Hortman, former Speaker of the Minnesota House of Representatives, whose remarkable journey in public service was cut short in June 2025. From her early fascination with politics while watching the 1980 presidential election as a ten-year-old to becoming one of Minnesota's most influential legislative leaders, Hortman's story exemplifies dedication to progressive values and effective governance. Her tenure as Speaker from 2019 to 2025 saw landmark achievements including Minnesota's solar energy standard, expanded abortion protections, paid family leave, and tuition-free college for families earning under $80,000. Known for her ability to build bridges while maintaining strong convictions, Hortman earned respect across party lines while championing policies that improved countless lives. Her assassination, alongside her husband Mark, by a politically motivated gunman in their Brooklyn Park home, sent shockwaves through Minnesota's political landscape and highlighted the growing dangers faced by public servants. Governor Tim Walz's tribute captured her essence: someone who served with grace, compassion, and an unwavering determination to make Minnesota better. Though her life ended tragically at 55, Hortman's legacy endures through the transformative legislation she shepherded and the lives she touched during her two decades of public service.

      <description><![CDATA[In this poignant episode of Briefly Remembered, we explore the extraordinary legacy of Leonard Lauder, the visionary who transformed Estée Lauder from a modest family business into a global beauty empire. From his early days working alongside his mother Estée to building a $16 billion cosmetics powerhouse, Lauder's business acumen was matched only by his passionate commitment to art and philanthropy. The episode delves into his revolutionary "gift with purchase" concept that became an industry standard, and his strategic decision to maintain Estée Lauder's prestigious department store exclusivity. Beyond his business achievements, we uncover Lauder's remarkable art collection, culminating in his historic $1 billion Cubist art donation to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. His personal philosophy of frugality despite immense wealth, and his dedication to Alzheimer's research through the Alzheimer's Drug Discovery Foundation, reveal a man whose true wealth lay in his generosity and vision. Through intimate details of his relationships, including his 52-year marriage to Evelyn and later life with Judith Glickman, we paint a portrait of a man who found success not just in business metrics, but in the lives he touched and the legacy he created.

From his early days working alongside his mother Estée to building a $16 billion cosmetics powerhouse, Lauder's business acumen was matched only by his passionate commitment to art and philanthropy. The episode delves into his revolutionary "gift with purchase" concept that became an industry standard, and his strategic decision to maintain Estée Lauder's prestigious department store exclusivity. Beyond his business achievements, we uncover Lauder's remarkable art collection, culminating in his historic $1 billion Cubist art donation to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. His personal philosophy of frugality despite immense wealth, and his dedication to Alzheimer's research through the Alzheimer's Drug Discovery Foundation, reveal a man whose true wealth lay in his generosity and vision. Through intimate details of his relationships, including his 52-year marriage to Evelyn and later life with Judith Glickman, we paint a portrait of a man who found success not just in business metrics, but in the lives he touched and the legacy he created.
