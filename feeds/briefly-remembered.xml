      <itunes:episodeType>full</itunes:episodeType>
      <description><![CDATA[In this poignant episode of Briefly Remembered, we explore the legacy of David Greenwood, the former Chicago Bulls forward who recently passed away at 68. From his pivotal decision to honor his UCLA commitment after John Wooden's departure to his impressive NBA career spanning multiple teams, Greenwood's story embodies the essence of professional basketball in the pre-social media era. As the second overall pick in the 1979 NBA draft, following Magic Johnson, Greenwood left an indelible mark on the sport, averaging 16.3 points and 9.4 rebounds in his rookie season with the Bulls. His collegiate career at UCLA was equally remarkable, finishing 15th in all-time scoring and fourth in rebounds - a testament to his skill in a program that produced legends like Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Bill Walton. Beyond his playing career, Greenwood's impact continued as he led Verbum Dei High School to consecutive state championships as a coach. His journey culminated in an NBA championship with the Detroit Pistons' "Bad Boys" in 1990, but his true legacy lies in the quiet dignity and unwavering professionalism he brought to the game, representing an era when character and consistency meant more than headlines.

      <description><![CDATA[In this poignant episode of Briefly Remembered, we explore the revolutionary legacy of Norma Swenson, a pioneering force in women's health advocacy who passed away at 93. From her groundbreaking conscious childbirth experience in 1958 to co-founding the influential Boston Women's Health Book Collective, Swenson's journey transformed women's healthcare globally. As the driving force behind "Our Bodies, Ourselves," a landmark publication that reached millions worldwide, she challenged medical authority and championed women's autonomy over their bodies. Her impact extended across 34 countries, where she helped local women's groups adapt the book to their cultural contexts. At Harvard School of Public Health, Swenson established the university's first Women and Health course, while her work with the World Health Organization shaped global health policy. Until her final days in 2025, she remained a fierce advocate for women's bodily autonomy, leaving behind a legacy that continues to inspire healthcare advocacy and feminist movements worldwide. Her story exemplifies how one woman's determination to question medical patriarchy sparked a global revolution in women's health literacy and self-determination.

      <description><![CDATA[In this poignant episode of Briefly Remembered, we explore the remarkable life and legacy of Richard Chamberlain, the iconic actor who captivated audiences for over six decades. From his breakthrough role as Dr. James Kildare to his courageous personal journey, Chamberlain's story transcends mere Hollywood stardom. Born in Beverly Hills in 1934, he defied expectations by transforming from television heartthrob to respected classical actor, becoming the first American since John Barrymore to play Hamlet on British soil. The episode delves into his artistic evolution, from the phenomenal success of "Dr. Kildare" to his reign as the "King of Miniseries" in productions that defined a television era. Beyond his professional achievements, we examine Chamberlain's profound personal journey, including his late-in-life decision to publicly acknowledge his sexuality through his memoir "Shattered Love" at age 69. His final chapter in Hawaii, reconciled with longtime partner Martin Rabbett, brings full circle a life marked by both tremendous public success and private authenticity. Through intimate details and thoughtful reflection, this episode celebrates a pioneering artist who ultimately found the courage to embrace his true self, leaving behind not just an estimated $25 million estate but an enduring legacy of artistic excellence and personal growth.

      <description><![CDATA[In this poignant episode of Briefly Remembered, we delve into the life and tragic death of Melissa Hortman, the former Minnesota House Speaker whose legislative legacy was cut short by political violence in June 2025. From her first election to the Minnesota House in 2004 to her transformative tenure as Speaker beginning in 2019, Hortman emerged as a masterful coalition builder who orchestrated what became known as the "Minnesota Miracle" - a sweeping progressive agenda that reshaped the state's political landscape. Under her leadership, Minnesota enacted landmark legislation including the PRO Act protecting abortion rights, universal paid family leave, free school meals, and comprehensive gun control measures. Her practical approach to politics, combining progressive vision with pragmatic coalition-building, enabled unprecedented legislative achievements. Hortman's commitment to improving lives through democratic processes stood in stark contrast to the extremism that ultimately claimed her life at age 55. Her assassination alongside her husband Mark, part of a planned attack that also targeted State Senator John Hoffman, sent shockwaves through Minnesota's political establishment and highlighted the growing threat of political violence. Yet her enduring legacy lives on through the transformative policies she championed, from environmental protections to expanded voting rights, that continue to benefit millions of Minnesotans.

      <description><![CDATA[In this poignant episode of Briefly Remembered, we explore the extraordinary life and legacy of Leonard Lauder, the visionary business titan who transformed his mother's modest cosmetics venture into the global beauty empire Estée Lauder Companies. From his strategic brilliance in creating a multi-brand beauty conglomerate to his remarkable philanthropy and art collecting, Lauder's journey exemplifies the perfect blend of business acumen and cultural impact. The episode delves into his revolutionary marketing strategies, including the exclusive department store distribution model that defined luxury beauty retail, and his creation of seemingly competing brands that ultimately strengthened the parent company. Beyond his business achievements, we uncover Lauder's lesser-known passions, from his impressive collection of 125,000 postcards to his transformative $1 billion Cubist art donation to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. His philanthropic endeavors, including co-founding the Alzheimer's Drug Discovery Foundation and supporting the Breast Cancer Research Foundation, showcase a man whose influence extended far beyond the beauty industry. Despite his immense wealth, Lauder's Depression-era values and dedication to mentorship shaped a leadership style that earned him deep admiration from employees worldwide.

      <description><![CDATA[In this poignant episode of Briefly Remembered, we explore the extraordinary legacy of Joel Shapiro, the visionary sculptor who passed away at 83 in Manhattan. Known for transforming minimalist geometric forms into dynamic expressions of human movement, Shapiro revolutionized contemporary sculpture by bridging the gap between abstraction and recognition. From his early days as a Peace Corps volunteer in India to becoming a celebrated figure in the art world, Shapiro's journey reflects a deep commitment to both artistic innovation and human connection. His masterful manipulation of bronze and steel created sculptures that seemed to defy gravity, turning simple geometric shapes into powerful representations of motion and life. The episode delves into his remarkable ability to infuse cold, industrial forms with a sense of vitality that resonated with viewers worldwide, from his groundbreaking works of the 1970s to his final exhibition in Mexico in early 2025. Shapiro's enduring influence on modern sculpture, particularly his installation at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, demonstrates how abstract art can convey profound human experiences. His philosophy that "art is about degrees of rapture" continues to inspire contemporary artists and challenges our understanding of what sculpture can achieve.

The acclaimed actor, who captivated audiences with commanding performances in classics like "The French Connection" and "Unforgiven," passed away at 95 in his Santa Fe home. The episode reveals the heartbreaking circumstances surrounding his death, including the tragic loss of his wife Betsy Arakawa days earlier to a rare hantavirus infection. Hackman's journey from Marine to mailroom clerk to Oscar-winning actor epitomizes the American dream, achieving his breakthrough role in "Bonnie and Clyde" at age 37. His illustrious career, spanning four decades and garnering two Academy Awards and four Golden Globes, showcased his exceptional talent and versatility. Perhaps most telling was his dignified exit from Hollywood in 2004, choosing a quiet life in Santa Fe where he pursued writing and lived simply with his beloved wife. This intimate look at Hackman's final days provides a touching reflection on a man who, despite playing some of cinema's most intimidating characters, ultimately chose peace over the spotlight, crafting a finale that was both profound and deeply human.
