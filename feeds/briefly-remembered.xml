      <description><![CDATA[In this poignant episode of Briefly Remembered, we explore the remarkable legacy of David Greenwood, the former NBA power forward whose journey from Compton to NBA champion exemplifies perseverance and quiet excellence. Selected second overall in the 1979 NBA draft after Magic Johnson, Greenwood's career wasn't defined by what could have been, but rather by what was: 12 seasons of unwavering consistency and determination. From his early days playing multiple games across different parks in a single day to becoming a two-time All-American at UCLA, Greenwood's work ethic set him apart. Despite battling chronic foot injuries that felt like "broken glass" with every step, he maintained impressive career averages and ultimately secured an NBA championship with the 1990 Detroit Pistons. Beyond his professional achievements, Greenwood's post-NBA life showcased his entrepreneurial spirit through his Blockbuster video stores ownership and his dedication to youth development, leading Verbum Dei High School to two state championships as coach. His recent passing at age 68 reminds us that true greatness often lies not in spectacular moments, but in the day-to-day commitment to excellence and resilience in the face of adversity.
