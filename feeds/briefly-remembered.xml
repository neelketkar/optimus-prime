                    <description><![CDATA[In this poignant episode of Briefly Remembered, we explore the lasting legacy of Anthony "Tony" Braca, a passionate community advocate whose final crusade transformed Millburn, New Jersey. Through intimate storytelling, we follow Tony's unwavering dedication to his hometown, culminating in his last public appearance at a township committee meeting just days before his passing in March 2025. The episode weaves together the touching story of a man who understood that local governance isn't about grand gestures, but about the minute details that affect daily lives. From his fight to keep Main Street accessible for emergency vehicles, inspired by his friend Armando Valles's medical emergency, to his practical approach to environmental policies, Tony exemplified grassroots advocacy at its finest. His story resonates beyond Millburn's borders, illustrating how one citizen's persistent voice can shape a community's future. The episode captures the essence of civic engagement through Tony's journey, from his marriage to Alyson Baker Leuzarder in 2006 to his final days advocating for his neighbors, culminating in the proposed dedication of Town Hall Plaza in his memory.
