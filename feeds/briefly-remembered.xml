      <itunes:episodeType>full</itunes:episodeType>
      <description><![CDATA[In this poignant episode of Briefly Remembered, we explore the legacy of David Greenwood, the former Chicago Bulls forward who recently passed away at 68. From his pivotal decision to honor his UCLA commitment after John Wooden's departure to his impressive NBA career spanning multiple teams, Greenwood's story embodies the essence of professional basketball in the pre-social media era. As the second overall pick in the 1979 NBA draft, following Magic Johnson, Greenwood left an indelible mark on the sport, averaging 16.3 points and 9.4 rebounds in his rookie season with the Bulls. His collegiate career at UCLA was equally remarkable, finishing 15th in all-time scoring and fourth in rebounds - a testament to his skill in a program that produced legends like Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Bill Walton. Beyond his playing career, Greenwood's impact continued as he led Verbum Dei High School to consecutive state championships as a coach. His journey culminated in an NBA championship with the Detroit Pistons' "Bad Boys" in 1990, but his true legacy lies in the quiet dignity and unwavering professionalism he brought to the game, representing an era when character and consistency meant more than headlines.

      <description><![CDATA[In this poignant episode of Briefly Remembered, we explore the revolutionary legacy of Norma Swenson, a pioneering force in women's health advocacy who passed away at 93. From her groundbreaking conscious childbirth experience in 1958 to co-founding the influential Boston Women's Health Book Collective, Swenson's journey transformed women's healthcare globally. As the driving force behind "Our Bodies, Ourselves," a landmark publication that reached millions worldwide, she challenged medical authority and championed women's autonomy over their bodies. Her impact extended across 34 countries, where she helped local women's groups adapt the book to their cultural contexts. At Harvard School of Public Health, Swenson established the university's first Women and Health course, while her work with the World Health Organization shaped global health policy. Until her final days in 2025, she remained a fierce advocate for women's bodily autonomy, leaving behind a legacy that continues to inspire healthcare advocacy and feminist movements worldwide. Her story exemplifies how one woman's determination to question medical patriarchy sparked a global revolution in women's health literacy and self-determination.

      <description><![CDATA[In this poignant episode of Briefly Remembered, we explore the remarkable life and legacy of Richard Chamberlain, the iconic actor who captivated audiences for over six decades. From his breakthrough role as Dr. James Kildare to his courageous personal journey, Chamberlain's story transcends mere Hollywood stardom. Born in Beverly Hills in 1934, he defied expectations by transforming from television heartthrob to respected classical actor, becoming the first American since John Barrymore to play Hamlet on British soil. The episode delves into his artistic evolution, from the phenomenal success of "Dr. Kildare" to his reign as the "King of Miniseries" in productions that defined a television era. Beyond his professional achievements, we examine Chamberlain's profound personal journey, including his late-in-life decision to publicly acknowledge his sexuality through his memoir "Shattered Love" at age 69. His final chapter in Hawaii, reconciled with longtime partner Martin Rabbett, brings full circle a life marked by both tremendous public success and private authenticity. Through intimate details and thoughtful reflection, this episode celebrates a pioneering artist who ultimately found the courage to embrace his true self, leaving behind not just an estimated $25 million estate but an enduring legacy of artistic excellence and personal growth.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[In this poignant episode of Briefly Remembered, we explore the remarkable life and legacy of Ananda Lewis, the beloved MTV VJ who touched millions of hearts before her untimely passing at age 52. From her early days at the San Diego School of Creative and Performing Arts to becoming one of MTV's most influential personalities, Lewis's journey exemplified authenticity and cultural impact. Her transition from BET's "Teen Summit" to MTV's groundbreaking programming demonstrated her unique ability to bridge entertainment with meaningful social discourse. The episode delves into her multifaceted career, including her pioneering work addressing issues like racial profiling and school violence, her successful talk show, and later ventures into contracting and carpentry. We examine her courageous four-year battle with breast cancer, during which she became a passionate advocate for early detection while making deeply personal healthcare choices. Through intimate details and firsthand accounts, including her final conversations with CNN and published reflections in Essence, this episode paints a portrait of a woman who lived life on her own terms, leaving behind a legacy that transcends her roles as an entertainer, mother, and cultural icon.

      <description><![CDATA[In this poignant episode of Briefly Remembered, we delve into the life and tragic death of Melissa Hortman, the former Minnesota House Speaker whose legislative legacy was cut short by political violence in June 2025. From her first election to the Minnesota House in 2004 to her transformative tenure as Speaker beginning in 2019, Hortman emerged as a masterful coalition builder who orchestrated what became known as the "Minnesota Miracle" - a sweeping progressive agenda that reshaped the state's political landscape. Under her leadership, Minnesota enacted landmark legislation including the PRO Act protecting abortion rights, universal paid family leave, free school meals, and comprehensive gun control measures. Her practical approach to politics, combining progressive vision with pragmatic coalition-building, enabled unprecedented legislative achievements. Hortman's commitment to improving lives through democratic processes stood in stark contrast to the extremism that ultimately claimed her life at age 55. Her assassination alongside her husband Mark, part of a planned attack that also targeted State Senator John Hoffman, sent shockwaves through Minnesota's political establishment and highlighted the growing threat of political violence. Yet her enduring legacy lives on through the transformative policies she championed, from environmental protections to expanded voting rights, that continue to benefit millions of Minnesotans.

      <description><![CDATA[In this poignant episode of Briefly Remembered, we explore the extraordinary life and legacy of Leonard Lauder, the visionary business titan who transformed his mother's modest cosmetics venture into the global beauty empire Estée Lauder Companies. From his strategic brilliance in creating a multi-brand beauty conglomerate to his remarkable philanthropy and art collecting, Lauder's journey exemplifies the perfect blend of business acumen and cultural impact. The episode delves into his revolutionary marketing strategies, including the exclusive department store distribution model that defined luxury beauty retail, and his creation of seemingly competing brands that ultimately strengthened the parent company. Beyond his business achievements, we uncover Lauder's lesser-known passions, from his impressive collection of 125,000 postcards to his transformative $1 billion Cubist art donation to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. His philanthropic endeavors, including co-founding the Alzheimer's Drug Discovery Foundation and supporting the Breast Cancer Research Foundation, showcase a man whose influence extended far beyond the beauty industry. Despite his immense wealth, Lauder's Depression-era values and dedication to mentorship shaped a leadership style that earned him deep admiration from employees worldwide.

      <itunes:episodeType>full</itunes:episodeType>
      <description><![CDATA[In this poignant episode of Briefly Remembered, we explore the extraordinary legacy of Joel Shapiro, the influential sculptor who revolutionized contemporary art through his dynamic bronze figures and masterful manipulation of space. From his early days creating miniature cast-iron houses to his iconic stick figures that seemed to dance between stability and motion, Shapiro's five-decade career challenged conventional notions of sculptural art. Born to a physician father and microbiologist mother in New York City, Shapiro's journey from reluctant pre-med student to acclaimed artist was transformed by his Peace Corps experience in India. His breakthrough came with his "tiny house period," but it was his signature style of geometric figures that earned him international recognition. With over 160 solo exhibitions worldwide and more than 30 public sculptures, including the powerful "Loss and Regeneration" at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, Shapiro's work consistently pushed the boundaries of scale and perception. Despite numerous accolades, including election to the American Academy of Arts and Letters and France's Chevalier dans l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, he remained remarkably unpretentious, letting his forms speak their own language. His final exhibition at Pace Gallery, featuring the monumental "ARK," demonstrated his enduring commitment to artistic innovation until his passing at 83.
