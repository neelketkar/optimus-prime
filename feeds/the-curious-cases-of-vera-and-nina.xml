                <description><![CDATA[In this delightful episode of The Curious Cases of Vera and Nina, young detective Vera faces a personal mystery when her cherished purple softball bat vanishes from Marine Park. Alongside her sister Nina, their theatrical squirrel companion Herman, and the wise but weary beagle Bean, they embark on an investigation that weaves together nostalgia and neighborhood intrigue. The case takes an unexpected turn when Bean's keen nose detects the distinct scent of vintage '90s snacks, specifically Dunkaroos, leading the team to discover a connection between the missing bat and their neighbor Tommy's garage sale. This episode skillfully blends elements of youth sports, sibling teamwork, and the importance of honest communication, all while incorporating beloved nostalgic references that will resonate with parents and children alike. The mystery unfolds against the backdrop of Santa Monica's Ocean Park neighborhood, where the young detectives learn valuable lessons about borrowing, asking permission, and the power of forgiveness. Through clever deduction and teamwork, Vera and her friends not only recover the bat but also help Tommy understand the importance of respecting others' property.
