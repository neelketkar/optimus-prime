When beachgoers notice an unusual coconut-and-fish smell and the beach appears suspiciously empty during peak season, the sisters uncover a scheme involving fake sunscreen made from coconut oil and fish oil supplements. Their sleuthing reveals that local vendor Mr. Peterson unknowingly purchased and resold these dangerous substitutes, putting tourists at risk of severe sunburns. The episode cleverly weaves together elements of environmental awareness, consumer safety, and the importance of proper sun protection while maintaining a lighthearted, humorous tone through Herman's dramatic commentary and Bean's skeptical reactions. This family-friendly mystery highlights the real-world issue of counterfeit sunscreen products and the importance of using FDA-approved sun protection.

Their investigation takes them from Herman's "summer palace" in Marine Park to his practice stage in Memorial Park, following a peculiar trail of organic walnuts down Ocean Park Boulevard. What initially appears to be a potential squirrel-napping case transforms into a delightful discovery – Herman, the aspiring director, is found teaching dance routines to his squirrel theater troupe behind Whole Foods, preparing for their summer production of "Squirrels Just Wanna Have Fun." This charming tale of friendship, performing arts, and misunderstandings showcases the unique bond between the sisters and their dramatic squirrel friend, who proves that sometimes following your artistic passion means missing breakfast – even if it's pancakes.

Following a trail of white fluff from their Santa Monica home through the alley, they uncover an unexpected architectural endeavor: Herman's cousin Harriet and her squirrel companions have been "borrowing" toilet paper to construct an eco-friendly sanctuary in the Marine Park community garden. What initially seemed like a potential supply chain crisis or pandemic-style hoarding turns out to be a clever example of sustainable wildlife engineering. The sisters negotiate a peaceful resolution, arranging for dedicated construction materials while protecting the neighborhood's paper products from further squirrel requisitioning. This charming mystery showcases the importance of communication, creative problem-solving, and understanding different perspectives - even when they belong to architectural squirrels.
