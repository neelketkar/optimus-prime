When her instrument repeatedly loses pitch before an important Memorial Park recital, Vera and her sister Nina embark on a musical mystery, accompanied by their skeptical beagle Bean. While Nina suggests supernatural explanations inspired by classic horror shows, the truth proves far more amusing – their local squirrel friend Herman has been mistaking the violin's tuning pegs for his morning workout equipment. Through clever deduction and Bean's keen nose, the sisters discover telltale walnut dust on the strings, revealing Herman's secret "squirrel aerobics" routine. This charming tale weaves together themes of friendship, problem-solving, and the unexpected ways music brings a neighborhood's creatures together, culminating in a creative solution that keeps both violin and squirrel in harmony.

                    <description><![CDATA[When the entire neighborhood's toilet paper mysteriously vanishes, sisters Vera and Nina spring into action with their animal detective squad - Herman the dramatic squirrel and Bean the grumpy but reliable beagle. Following a trail of white fluff from their Santa Monica home through the alley, they uncover an unexpected architectural endeavor: Herman's cousin Harriet and her squirrel companions have been "borrowing" toilet paper to construct an eco-friendly sanctuary in the Marine Park community garden. What initially seemed like a potential supply chain crisis or pandemic-style hoarding turns out to be a clever example of sustainable wildlife engineering. The sisters negotiate a peaceful resolution, arranging for dedicated construction materials while protecting the neighborhood's paper products from further squirrel requisitioning. This charming mystery showcases the importance of communication, creative problem-solving, and understanding different perspectives - even when they belong to architectural squirrels.

When Herman, the theatrical rodent known for his Sunday pancake-watching ritual, fails to appear at his usual window perch, Nina and Vera embark on a neighborhood search with their keen-nosed companion Bean. Their investigation takes them from Herman's "summer palace" in Marine Park to his practice stage in Memorial Park, following a peculiar trail of organic walnuts down Ocean Park Boulevard.

This charming tale of friendship, performing arts, and misunderstandings showcases the unique bond between the sisters and their dramatic squirrel friend, who proves that sometimes following your artistic passion means missing breakfast – even if it's pancakes.
