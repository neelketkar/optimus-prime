                <description><![CDATA[In this thrilling episode of The Curious Cases of Vera and Nina, our young detectives uncover a mysterious scheme involving suspicious shimmering sunscreen at Marine Park. When local children start exhibiting an unusual bluish glow, Vera and Nina, aided by their perceptive beagle Bean and the theatrical squirrel Herman, launch into an investigation that reveals a disturbing environmental plot. The discovery of a pop-up stand selling "Super Safe Shimmer Screen" raises red flags, especially when Bean, known for her adventurous nose, refuses to go near it. The sisters' collaboration with Dr. Martinez at Santa Monica College unveils a sinister truth: the fake sunscreen contains microplastic particles designed to affect atmospheric conditions, with unsuspecting children as test subjects. Through clever detective work, scientific analysis, and the unlikely combination of a drama-loving squirrel's knowledge of atmospheric science and a beagle's trustworthy instincts, the team tracks down the culprit to an abandoned Blockbuster. This episode brilliantly weaves together environmental awareness, citizen science, and the importance of trusting your instincts (especially if they belong to a beagle), all while delivering an engaging mystery that highlights the growing concern about microplastics in our environment.

                <description><![CDATA[In this whimsical episode of The Curious Cases of Vera and Nina, listeners are treated to a delightful mystery involving Herman, the charismatic talking squirrel with a surprising secret from the 90s. When Herman fails to appear for his weekly Fruit Loop picnic with Nina, concern quickly spreads through Marine Park. With the help of their elderly but keen-nosed beagle Bean, Nina and her pragmatic sister Vera follow a trail of scattered cereal and mysterious glitter to the local farmers market. There, they discover Herman's unexpected past as the star of a 1995 Nickelodeon Moon Shoes commercial, now holding court among nostalgic Gen X parents. The episode masterfully weaves together themes of friendship, 90s nostalgia, and the sometimes surprising hidden depths of those closest to us. Through clever dialogue and endearing character dynamics, the story showcases the series' signature blend of whimsy and heart, while exploring how even the smallest creatures can have the biggest personalities. Herman's dramatic revelation about his brief but memorable television career adds a delightful layer to his already colorful character, while Bean's sardonic observations provide the perfect counterpoint to the squirrel's theatrical nature.
