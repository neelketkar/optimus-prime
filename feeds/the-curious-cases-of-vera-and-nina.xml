Together with her sister Nina, their beagle Bean, and Herman the squirrel, they uncover a neighborhood-wide crisis affecting everything from speakers to security cameras. The investigation leads them to discover that a neighbor's amateur network security testing, combined with their father's well-intentioned mesh network setup, has triggered a "smart device apocalypse." Using Bean's intuitive suggestion and Nina's quick organizing skills, they coordinate a synchronized router reset across the neighborhood, restoring harmony to their connected community. This charming episode explores themes of modern technology dependence, community cooperation, and the unintended consequences of DIY network security testing, all while delivering practical insights into troubleshooting smart home devices.

As she prepares for her upcoming recital at Memorial Park, Vera's violin repeatedly loses its tune, causing frustration and concern. Her sister Nina's playful suggestion of a haunted instrument gives way to keen observation when she spots telltale walnut dust on the strings. The mystery unravels when Herman, their squirrel friend, confesses to mistaking the violin's tuning pegs for his morning workout equipment, having confused them with walnuts from the new tree at Clover Park. This whimsical tale of music, misunderstandings, and squirrel aerobics showcases the clever problem-solving abilities of the sister detectives, while their loyal beagle Bean provides silent support from her window-side perch. The solution comes with a creative compromise: real walnuts from Gelson's in exchange for leaving the violin's pegs intact.

                    <description><![CDATA[A clever crow with an eye for fashion transforms a peaceful Sunday afternoon into a peculiar mystery when all the freshly folded laundry vanishes from the living room couch. Sisters Vera and Nina, along with their grumpy but astute beagle Bean and Herman the theatrical squirrel, follow a trail of clues from their Sunset Park home to Marine Park's playground. The investigation reveals an enterprising bird who's been methodically "borrowing" clothing from the neighborhood to create the most stylish nest in Santa Monica, complete with Dad's running shirt and Mom's missing yoga pants. Through careful observation, teamwork, and help from their animal companions, the young detectives piece together how the crafty crow managed to dismantle an hour's worth of folding, one garment at a time, proving that sometimes the most unusual suspects have a flair for interior decorating that extends well beyond their natural habitat.

Following their grumpy but reliable beagle Bean's keen nose, sisters Vera and Nina uncover a peculiar trail of paper leading to Marine Park's community garden. With help from their dramatic squirrel friend Herman, they discover his cousin Harriet leading an ambitious architectural project – an eco-friendly squirrel sanctuary built entirely from "borrowed" toilet paper. The sisters' detective work reveals that what initially seemed like a neighborhood conspiracy turns out to be a creative example of urban wildlife adaptation. This charming mystery showcases themes of sustainability, family dynamics, and the importance of communication as the girls negotiate a peaceful resolution between the human and squirrel communities of Santa Monica. Their investigation proves that sometimes the most surprising explanations are also the simplest ones, especially when dealing with resourceful rodents with a flair for sustainable architecture.

With their grumpy beagle Bean and Herman, a theatrical squirrel, they follow a peculiar trail of peanut butter from their backyard to Memorial Park, where they uncover an unexpected scene. Their neighbor, Mrs. Applebaum, a former physical therapist, has repurposed their balls for her senior yoga class, using peanut butter as a makeshift grip aid for her arthritis-affected students. This charming mystery highlights the importance of community, creative problem-solving, and the unexpected ways people adapt everyday items for therapeutic purposes, though perhaps borrowing without asking wasn't the best approach.

                    <content:encoded><![CDATA[A mysterious morning unfolds in Santa Monica's Sunset Park when sisters Vera and Nina discover all their sports balls mysteriously deflated. With their grumpy beagle Bean and Herman, a theatrical squirrel, they follow a peculiar trail of peanut butter from their backyard to Memorial Park, where they uncover an unexpected scene. Their neighbor, Mrs. Applebaum, a former physical therapist, has repurposed their balls for her senior yoga class, using peanut butter as a makeshift grip aid for her arthritis-affected students. This charming mystery highlights the importance of community, creative problem-solving, and the unexpected ways people adapt everyday items for therapeutic purposes, though perhaps borrowing without asking wasn't the best approach.

With the help of her sister Vera, dressed as Wednesday Addams, their theatrical squirrel friend Herman, and a reluctant beagle named Bean, the search begins through Nina's hurricane-swept room. Following a trail of purple glitter to the closet, they discover Herman's well-intentioned but chaotic attempt to enhance the costume with Christmas lights and choreography notes, inspired by a Broadway production of Cats. What starts as a costume crisis transforms into a heartwarming moment when they realize Herman's glittery additions actually improve the magical Mirabel ensemble, making it even more special for their candy-collecting adventure through Santa Monica.

Young detectives Vera and Nina, along with their faithful beagle Bean and witty squirrel companion Herman, spring into action from their spot at Salt & Straw ice cream parlor. The investigation takes an unexpected turn when they discover a working GameBoy Color behind a dumpster - an unusual clue in 2025. Following a trail of scattered receipts to the Venice Canals, the team connects the dots between their ice cream order, the vintage gaming device, and the teenage culprit. The case showcases the charm of Venice Beach's iconic locations while weaving together elements of mystery, friendship, and justice, all sparked by a stolen Dooney & Bourke purse. Through clever deduction and teamwork (plus a perfectly-timed slip on melted ice cream), our young sleuths prove that even the smallest detectives can solve big cases in their beloved beachside community.

When Miss Martinez discovers her rose gold ring has vanished somewhere between Gelson's produce aisle and her car, the unlikely detective squad springs into action. While Nina and Herman investigate inside the store, Vera and Bean's outdoor search leads them to mysterious clues - a receipt for retro candy and some skateboarding suspects at Marine Park. Through clever deduction, teamwork, and Herman's dramatic flair for tight spaces, they ultimately discover the ring wedged in an unexpected place: the automatic door track at Gelson's, where Miss Martinez had been practicing a TikTok dance trend. This whimsical mystery showcases the power of observation, collaboration, and thinking outside the box - even when the solution is right under your nose.
